                <h3>1. Use and interpretation</h3>
                <p>The Exchange Rules and Regulations ("Exchange Rules") are part of terms and conditions.</p>
                <p>The Exchange Rules apply to all bets placed on Exchange markets. The Exchange Rules also apply to
                    Exchange ’Multiples’ product (see the Multiples section below for further details). The Exchange
                    Rules consist of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This INTRODUCTION section (Part A);</li>
                    <li>The GENERAL RULES (set out in Part B below);</li>
                    <li>The SPECIFIC SPORTS RULES (set out in Part C below – these apply to certain sports and to
                        financial markets); and</li>
                    <li>The MARKET INFORMATION (located on every market either under the tab entitled "Rules" or under
                        the ‘Rules’).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The General Rules apply to all bets unless stated otherwise in the Market Information or the Specific
                    Sports Rules. If there is any inconsistency between the Specific Sports Rules and the General Rules,
                    the Specific Sports Rules shall prevail. If there is any inconsistency between the Market
                    Information and either the General Rules or the Specific Sports Rules, the Market Information shall
                    prevail, except where the General Rules or Specific Sports Rules use the phrase 'regardless of what
                    it says in the Market Information' or similar wording.</p>
                <p>For any category or market not referred to in the Specific Sports Rules (e.g. ’Special Bets’ or beach
                    volleyball), the General Rules and Market Information will apply.</p>

                <h3>2. Market information</h3>
                <p>The Market Information is provided for information purposes as an at-a-glance guide on how to manage
                    the market. The Market Information may also contain rules on market settlement, however it must
                    always be read in conjunction with the General Rules and the relevant Specific Sports Rules and a
                    link to this Rules and Regulations page will usually be provided in the Market Information for each
                    market.</p>
                <p>Whilst the Market Information may give a guide to how markets will be managed, regardless of what it
                    says in the Market Information, it reserves the right to suspend any market at any time at its sole
                    discretion, including in order to carry out necessary administration and/or to take any necessary
                    action to protect the customers.</p>
                <p>It shall not amend the Market Information after a market has been loaded except to correct obvious
                    errors and/or to add wording to clarify the Market Information where appropriate.</p>
                <h3>3. Customer responsibility</h3>
                <p>The customers should make themselves aware of all the Exchange Rules affecting any market on which
                    they wish to place a bet. Customers should not simply rely on the Market Information as the Market
                    Information is unlikely to contain all of the applicable rules relating to a market.</p>
                <p>By their nature ‘Special Bets’ markets are unpredictable so should be treated with particular
                    caution. Customers are responsible for managing their own positions at all times in such markets.
                    Customers should pay particular attention to the Market Information on ‘Special Bets’ markets to
                    ensure they understand the basis on which the market will be administered and settled.</p>
                <h3>4. Customer betting disputes &amp; IBAS</h3>
                <p>Any customer who has any concerns or questions regarding the Exchange Rules or regarding the
                    settlement of any market should contact.</p>
                <p>If a customer is not satisfied with how a bet or a market has been settled then the customer should
                    provide details of their grievance.</p>

                <h3>1. Managing markets In-Play</h3>
                <h4>a) General</h4>

                    <li>
                        For everything other than horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be
                        turned in-play but fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then:
                        <ul>
                            <li>if the event has a scheduled 'off' time, all bets matched after that scheduled off time
                                will be void; and</li>
                            <li>if the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its reasonable endeavours
                                to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off'
                                determined will be void.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>For horseracing and greyhound racing, if a market is not scheduled to be turned in-play but
                        fails to suspend the market at the relevant time, then all bets matched after the official 'off'
                        time will be void.</li>
                    <li>It aims to use its reasonable endeavours to suspend in-play markets at the start of and at the
                        end of the event. However, regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does not
                        guarantee that such markets will be suspended at the relevant time.</li>
                    <li>It will not part-suspend outcomes/selections in an Exchange market that has been turned in-play.
                    </li>

                    <li>For the purposes of in-play betting, customers should be aware that transmissions described as
                        "live" by some broadcasters may be delayed or pre-recorded. The extent of any delay may vary
                        depending on the set-up through which they are receiving pictures or data.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>b) All markets other than soccer markets and Australian markets - not suspending at the time of the
                    'off'</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In relation to markets which are scheduled to be turned in-play, aims to use its reasonable
                        endeavours to turn such markets in-play at the time of the 'off'. The time of the 'off' for such
                        markets should be set out in the Market Information. However, regardless of what it says in the
                        Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets will be suspended and turned in-play
                        at the time of the 'off'.</li>
                    <li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not suspend the market and cancel
                        unmatched bets at the time of the 'off' and the market is not turned in-play with unmatched bets
                        cancelled at any time during the event, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off'
                        will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void from the
                        official rather than the scheduled 'off' time). </li>
                    <li>If the event does not have a scheduled 'off' time, it will use its reasonable endeavours to
                        ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and all bets after the time of the 'off' determined will
                        be void.</li>
                    <li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but does not suspend the market at the time of the
                        'off' (so unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is intentionally turned
                        in-play at a later time during the event, all bets matched after the time of the 'off' will
                        stand</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>c) Soccer markets (with the exception of Australian soccer markets) - not suspending at kick-off or
                    on the occurrence of a Material Event</h4>
                <h5>Not suspending at kick-off</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In relation to soccer markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play, aims to use its
                        reasonable endeavours to turn such markets in-play at kick-off and to suspend such markets on
                        the occurrence of a Material Event (see definition of "Material Event" below).</li>
                    <li>The relevant scheduled kick-off time should be set out in the Market Information. However,
                        regardless of what it says in the Market Information, it does not guarantee that such markets
                        will be suspended and turned in-play at kick-off.</li>
                    <li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the market at kick-off and the
                        market is not turned in-play at any time during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled
                        time of the kick-off will be void.</li>
                    <li>If a market is scheduled to be turned in-play but not suspend the market at kick-off (so
                        unmatched bets are not cancelled at that time), but the market is turned in-play at a later time
                        during the match, all bets matched after the scheduled time of the kick-off and before the first
                        "Material Event" will stand. However, if there has been one or more "Material Events", any bets
                        matched between the first "Material Event" and the market being turned in-play will be void.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Not suspending on the occurrence of a Material Event</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>If it does not suspend a market on time for the occurrence of a Material Event, it reserves the
                        right to void bets unfairly matched after the Material Event has occurred. Voiding of these bets
                        may take place during the event or retrospectively once a game is completed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Definition of “Material Event”</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>For the purpose of these Exchange Rules, a "Material Event" shall mean a goal being scored, a
                        penalty being awarded or a player being sent off.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>d) In-play Australian markets</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Notwithstanding the other in-play rules described above, in relation specifically to any
                        Australian market that is scheduled to be turned in-play, if it fails to suspend the market at
                        the 'off' then all bets matched after the scheduled time of the 'off' and before the market is
                        turned in-play will be void (in the case of horseracing and greyhound racing, bets will be void
                        from the official rather than the scheduled ‘off’ time). If the event does not have a scheduled
                        'off' time, it will use its reasonable endeavours to ascertain the time of the actual 'off' and
                        all bets after the time of the 'off' as determined will be void.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Results and market settlement</h3>
                <h4>a) General</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Markets will be settled as set out in the Market Information and/or the Specific Sports Rules.

                        to correct an error in reporting the result).</li>
                    <li>If no official result of a relevant governing body is available, the result will be determined
                        by using information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into
                        the public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting reasonably) determine
                        either: (i) whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new
                        information; or (ii) whether or not to wait for further information before deciding whether to
                        reinstate or resettle the market. Except it has announced that it is waiting for further
                        information, any information that comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market
                        has been settled shall not be considered (regardless of whether or not such information may have
                        led to a different result).</li>
                    <li>In the event of any uncertainty about any result or potential result, it reserves the right to
                        suspend settlement of any market for an unlimited period until the uncertainty can be resolved
                        to the reasonable satisfaction. It reserves the right to void any market if the uncertainty
                        regarding settlement cannot be resolved to reasonable satisfaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>b) Resettlements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Markets are generally settled shortly after the end of the event in question. It may settle (or
                        part-settle) some markets before the official result is declared (or may increase a customer's
                        'available to bet' balance by the minimum potential winnings of that customer on a given market)
                        purely as a customer service benefit. However, it reserves the right to amend the settlement of
                        the market if: (i) the official result is different to the result on which initially settled the
                        market (for example, a horseracing result being changed by the relevant governing body shortly
                        after a race, but before the result is official); or (ii) if the whole market is eventually
                        voided (e.g. for an abandoned event).</li>
                    <li>It reserves the right to reverse the settlement of a market if a market is settled in error (for
                        example, a human or technical error).</li>
                    <li>If resettles a market, this may lead to amendments being made to a customer's balance to reflect
                        changes in market settlement.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>c) Non-runners, withdrawals and disqualifications</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Subject always right to void bets under its terms and conditions or for any exception under the
                        Exchange Rules, if a market contains a statement that says, "All bets stand, run or not" (or
                        something similar) in the Market Information, then all bets on a team or competitor will stand
                        regardless of whether or not the team or competitor starts the event or takes any part in the
                        event.</li>
                    <li>Where the Market Information does not stipulate that all bets will stand regardless of
                        participation, customers should refer to the relevant Specific Sports Rules.</li>
                    <li>If a team or competitor is disqualified, withdraws or forfeits after starting an event they will
                        be deemed a loser providing at least one other team or competitor completes the event. If no
                        team or competitor completes an event (having started) then all bets will be void except for
                        bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>d) Winner with [named selection]' markets</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>It may from time to time offer markets that are dependent on the participation of a particular
                        competitor. If the competitor named either in a 'Winner with …' market title or in the Market
                        Information does not participate in the tournament or event then all bets on the market will be
                        void. For example, if there was a "Winner with Federer" tennis market, all bets on the market
                        would be void if Federer did not participate in the tournament. However, if any other competitor
                        did not participate, then bets would stand.</li>
                    <li>A team or competitor will be deemed to have participated if they have taken part to the extent
                        necessary to record an official result or classification (including any disqualification but
                        excluding any "did not start" or equivalent classification).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Abandonments, Cancellations, Postponements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
                        Market Information. However, where a market has no rules in the Specific Sports Rules or the
                        Market Information in relation to an abandonment, cancellation and/or postponement the following
                        shall apply.</li>
                    <li>In relation to any match, fixture, game, individual event, race or similar: If the event is not
                        completed within three days after the scheduled completion date, then all bets on markets for
                        this event will be void, except for bets on any markets that have been unconditionally
                        determined.</li>
                    <li>In relation to any tournament, competition or similar: If the event is not completed within
                        three days after the scheduled completion date, then any markets relating to the event will be
                        settled in accordance with the official ruling of the relevant governing body, providing such a
                        decision is given within 90 days after the scheduled completion date. If no official ruling is
                        announced in this 90-day period, then bets on any market relating to this event will be void,
                        except for bets on any markets which have been unconditionally determined. If a market is to be
                        voided but has been part-settled as a courtesy to customers, then such part-settled bets will be
                        reversed and all bets on the market will be void.</li>
                    <li>It will decide (acting reasonably) whether a market relates to a match (or similar) or a
                        tournament (or similar). However, by way of example, the following shall apply: (i) Europa
                        League outright = tournament; (ii) Champions’ League Group outright = tournament; (iii) Top
                        Premiership goal scorer = tournament; (iv) 72-hole Golf Match bet = match; (v) Ryder Cup
                        outright = tournament; (vi) Golf tournament outright = tournament; (vii) Tennis Tournament
                        outright = tournament;(viii) 5-day Cricket Test Match = match; (ix) Ashes Series outright winner
                        = tournament; (x) Motor Race (e.g. Grand Prix) = match.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Change of venue</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
                        Market Information. However, if change of venue is not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules
                        and/or the Market Information then the following shall apply:</li>
                    <li>For any team sport: if the scheduled venue is changed after the market is loaded, all bets will
                        be void only if the new venue is a home ground of the original away team</li>
                    <li>For all categories or markets other than team sports: if the scheduled venue is changed after
                        the market is loaded, all bets will stand.</li>
                    <li>If there is a change in the type of scheduled surface (e.g. a hockey match switching from grass
                        to Astor-turf) after the market has been loaded, all bets will stand.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Periods of time</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
                        Market Information. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
                        Information then the following shall apply.</li>
                    <li>If the scheduled duration of an event is changed after the market has been loaded but before the
                        start of the event, then all bets will be void.</li>
                    <li>Some markets refer to the length of time until an occurrence in the event (e.g. time of first
                        goal). If an event happens in stoppage or injury time after any regular time period then it will
                        be deemed to have occurred at the end of the regular time period. For example, if a goal is
                        scored in first half stoppage-time in a soccer match it will be deemed to have occurred on 45
                        minutes.</li>
                    <li>All bets apply to the relevant full 'regular time' period including stoppage time. Any
                        extra-time and/or penalty shoot-out is not included.</li>
                    <li>References within these Rules and Regulations to a particular number of 'days' shall mean the
                        end of the day local time after the expiry of the specified number of days. For example, if a
                        rugby match is scheduled for the 1st of December, then the rule that allows the match to be
                        completed within three days after the scheduled completion date (see Paragraph 3 above) would
                        mean that the deadline for completion of that match would be 23.59:59 on the 4th of December.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Match bets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
                        Market Information. For example, for match bets on Golf markets the rules are set out in the
                        Specific Sports Rules. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
                        Information then the following shall apply.</li>
                    <li>'Match Bets' for one-off events are determined by the competitor or team with the best score,
                        time or finishing position in the event. If none of the competitors or teams involved in the
                        match bet complete the event or register a score, time or finishing position then bets are void
                        unless specified otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information. Any
                        competitor or team not completing an event or registering a score, time or finishing position
                        having taken part in the match bet event will be settled as a loser providing at least one other
                        team or competitor completes that event or registers a score, time or finishing position.</li>
                    <li>'Match Bets' for progress in a competition or event with multiple heats or rounds are determined
                        by the competitor or team which qualifies to the furthest round (whether it takes part in the
                        further round or not) or with the best score, time or finishing position in the final or same
                        heat of that competition or event. If the relevant competitors or teams fail to qualify in the
                        same round of the competition but in different heats then dead-heat rules will apply,
                        irrespective of the finishing positions in their respective heats. Markets will be part-settled
                        after the end of each round and any subsequent disqualifications, penalties or amendments to
                        results or qualifications will not have any effect on the market. Where one or more of the
                        competitors or teams are disqualified, for the purposes of settlement, the disqualified
                        competitor or team will be deemed to have progressed further in the competition or event than
                        all those eliminated from the competition or event prior to the disqualification, and will be
                        deemed to have finished last (or joint last if there is more than one disqualification) of those
                        still competing in the competition or event. Disqualification will be considered to have taken
                        place at the time of the competitor's or team's removal from the competition or event by the
                        relevant governing body, rather than at the time of the event which caused disqualification.
                    </li>
                    <li>If one of the competitors or teams does not take any part in the event, then all relevant match
                        bets will be void.</li>
                    <li>If an event or tournament is abandoned or reduced in duration such that any competitor or team
                        fails to complete the match bet, event or tournament for any reason other than withdrawal or
                        disqualification then all bets will be void except for those on markets which have been
                        unconditionally determined.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>7. "To qualify" markets</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some markets have different rules and these are listed in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the
                        Market Information. However, if not dealt with in the Specific Sports Rules or the Market
                        Information then the following shall apply.</li>
                    <li>Any 'to qualify' market (e.g. "to reach the final" markets) will be determined by the competitor
                        or team that qualifies under the terms set out in Market Information, whether or not they take
                        part in the next round or event for which they have qualified. Markets will be settled after the
                        qualifying stage and any subsequent disqualification or amendment to the result will not count.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>8. Dead heats</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unless stated otherwise in the Specific Sports Rules and/or the Market Information the Dead Heat
                        Rule applies to bets on a market where there are more winners than expected (as set out in the
                        Market Information).</li>
                    <li>For each bet matched on a relevant winning selection, the stake money is first reduced in
                        proportion by multiplying it by the sum of the number of winners expected (as set out in the
                        Market Information), divided by the number of actual winners (i.e. stake multiplied by (number
                        of winners expected/number of actual winners)). The winnings are then paid to the successful
                        backers on this 'reduced stake' (reduced stake multiplied by traded price) and the remaining
                        stake money is paid to the appropriate layers.</li>
                    <li>For example, assume there is a dead heat for first place between three horses. 'Client A' has
                        backed one of the winners for a stake of 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken
                        the other side of this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 1/3
                        (i.e. the number of expected winners (1) divided by the number of actual winners (3)) to
                        calculate the reduced stake (100) and the remainder given to the layer (200). The backer then
                        receives the traded price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 100 = 400). In this
                        example, Client A's net winnings are 100 (400 payout minus the original 300 stake), and Client
                        B's net losses are 100. Alternatively, this can be viewed as the full amount paid to the traded
                        price divided by the number of dead-heaters. In the above example, this would be 300 at the
                        traded price of 4.0 (1200) divided by 3; making 400 payouts and 100 net winnings.</li>
                    <li>By way of another example, assume there is an outright winner in a golf tournament but 7 players
                        tie for 2nd place. In the "top 5 finish" market, after settling on the outright winner in the
                        top 5 market there would be 4 others designated winner’s places available. 'Client A' has backed
                        one of the winners for 300 at the traded price of 4.0 and 'Client B' has taken the other side of
                        this bet. When the event is settled, the stake (300) is multiplied by 4/7 (i.e. the number of
                        expected winners (4) divided by the number of actual winners (7)) to calculate the reduced stake
                        (171.43) and the remainder given to the layer (128.57). The backer then receives the traded
                        price matched (4.0) multiplied by the reduced stake (4 x 171.43 = 685.72). In this example,
                        Client A's net winnings are 385.72 (685.72 payout minus the original 300 stake), and Client B's
                        net losses are 385.72.</li>
                    <li>In relation to customers whose betting counterparty, for the purposes of this section of the
                        Exchange Rules dealing with dead heats, the terms 'Client A', 'Client B' and 'appropriate
                        layers' should, where relevant, be read</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>9. Exchange Multiples</h3>
                <p>The Exchange Rules only apply to Exchange Multiples. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers placing a multiple bet will be betting with each other will act as the counterparty to
                        the bet.</li>
                    <li>A multiple bet consists of a number of legs. A leg is defined as one or more chosen selections
                        in any individual event market.</li>
                    <li>It reserves the right in its sole discretion not to accept certain multiple bets or to scale
                        back stakes in certain circumstances.</li>
                    <li>All multiple bets placed are subject to the Exchange Rules that apply to each individual sport
                        that relates to any leg of any multiple bet.</li>
                    <li>The maximum payout limit for Exchange Multiples is £1,000,000.</li>
                    <li>Customers can place an Exchange Multiple bet using back, or where available lay or a mixture of
                        back and lay selections. However, customers cannot have a combination of back and lay selections
                        in any one leg.</li>
                    <li>If customers choose more than one selection in one leg the odds for this leg will be "dutched"
                        which means they will be combined to reflect the chances of any of the selections within the leg
                        winning (if backed) or all of the selections losing (if laid). If customers wish to place a
                        cross-multiple bet (i.e. more than one selection in any event market but not using "dutched"
                        prices) they will need to enter each Exchange Multiple bet separately.</li>
                    <li>Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck at Starting Price ("BSP"), the odds available via the
                        Exchange Multiples product will be broadly based on the relevant singles markets on the Exchange
                        and any such winning multiple bet will be subject to commission as set out in the Charges'
                        section of the website.</li>
                    <li>Any winnings from Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP will not be subject to commission, but
                        the odds returned on each leg in such a multiple will be subject to a 5% deduction from the BSP.
                    </li>
                    <li>A BSP each way Exchange Multiple bet is a bet for selections in the multiple to win and a bet on
                        the same selections to place. For example, a £2 each way double represents a £2 bet on both
                        selections to win and a £2 bet on both selections to be placed, with a total stake for the bet
                        of £4. The number of places for each event in each way multiples bet are shown on the multiples
                        win Market Information and do not change. Should the number of runners be equal to or less than
                        the number of places available, the relevant place leg of any multiples bet will be void</li>
                    <li>The minimum total stake for any Exchange Multiple bet is £2. For example, a 20p "Yankee" (11 bet
                        combinations) representing a total stake of £2.20 is permitted. However, a 1p "Heinz" (57 bet
                        combinations) representing a total stake of £0.57 or a £1 double (1 bet combination)
                        representing a total stake of £1 will not be permitted. For customers betting in currencies
                        other than English Sterling, the minimum total stake which applies to an Exchange Multiple bet
                        will not necessarily be the equivalent of £2, though it will be calculated as described in the
                        example above.</li>
                    <li>If, in its sole discretion, will determine the markets that are available for Exchange
                        Multiples. Events available for Exchange Multiples will be those listed within any individual
                        Exchange Multiple group (e.g. UK football fixtures for any given day). Not all markets will be
                        available via the Exchange Multiples product.</li>
                    <li>With the exception of the rule directly below, if any selection in any leg is a non-runner or
                        otherwise void under the Exchange Rules (e.g. an abandoned match) then all bets on that
                        individual leg will be void and the Exchange Multiple bet shall be adjusted accordingly. For
                        example, a treble including one void leg will become a double. This means that if customers have
                        more than one selection in any leg (i.e. in cases of 'ditching') and one of those selections is
                        a non-runner, the whole leg will be void. In the event that voided legs mean that an individual
                        bet within a multiple becomes a single bet, then this single bet will stand.</li>
                    <li>Notwithstanding the rule directly above, for Exchange Multiples bets struck at BSP, if customers
                        have more than one selection in any leg and one of those selections is a non-runner the leg will
                        stand. For example, if customers back both Desert Orchid and Red Rum in an individual horse race
                        and Red Rum is a non-runner, the leg will become a back of just Desert Orchid.</li>
                    <li>It reserves the right not to accept certain combinations of Exchange Multiples, such as those
                        including related contingencies (i.e. where the outcome of one event is likely to affect the
                        odds on the outcome of another event). This may happen automatically at the bet placement stage.
                        Alternatively, if such bet is taken in error, it may void the individual bet combinations which
                        include two or more of the related contingency selections.</li>
                    <li>It may offer special markets on related events from time to time, including within its normal
                        markets (i.e. outside of the Exchange Multiples product), for example a market on Chelsea to win
                        the English domestic double (i.e. Premiership and FA Cup).</li>
                    <li>When placing any Exchange Multiple bet, the prices shown only give an indicative guide as to the
                        price available for each leg and the overall multiple. Other than Exchange Multiples bets struck
                        at BSP, the price of each leg and the overall multiple price that customers get will be fixed
                        when the multiple bet is actually placed and customers will then be able to see these prices.
                        For more details on this customer should refer to the 'help' files.</li>
                    <li>Horseracing Exchange Multiples are based on ‘day of the race’ markets (and not ante-post
                        markets). Horseracing ante-post rules do not therefore apply in relation to horseracing Exchange
                        Multiples.</li>

                <h3>10. Rules for Starting Price</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Starting Price ('SP') is available on the Exchange. Exchange SP bets (‘SP bets’) are therefore a
                        type of Exchange bet. The SP is calculated as, by balancing all SP bets and other Exchange bets
                        when the market is suspended at the 'off' of the relevant event. The details of this calculation
                        are provided directly below.</li>
                    <li>Please note that for all customers, an SP bet cannot be cancelled once it has been placed.</li>
                    <li>A bet at SP is a fixed odd bet, with the odds on each selection being calculated and bets
                        matched when the event starts. The odds are calculated by matching SP backers and other Exchange
                        backers against SP layers and other Exchange layers. The inclusion of other Exchange bets in the
                        SP reconciliation is necessary to ensure that: SP backers get the benefit of unmatched Exchange
                        offers to lay if those offers could increase the SP; and SP layers get the benefit of unmatched
                        Exchange offers to back if those offers could reduce the SP. Including unmatched other Exchange
                        in the SP reconciliation also ensures that the bets of other Exchange backers and layers, which
                        would otherwise lapse, are matched where possible.</li>
                    <li>The minimum liability for a bet placed at SP is £10 for a lay bet and £2 for a back bet (or the
                        currency equivalent in each case).</li>
                    <li>Example 1: on selection A there is £1,000 of backers' stakes and £6,000 of layers' liabilities
                        at SP and there are £500 of unmatched other Exchange back bets available to lay at an average of
                        5.0. If we ignored the Exchange market in this case the SP would be 7.0. However, this would
                        leave other Exchange back bets, that could also have been matched at their requested price
                        against SP layers, unmatched. Therefore, the SP will be 5.0 and all SP backers and SP layers
                        will be matched at that price. The £500 of Exchange backers' stakes will also be matched at
                        their requested price of 5.0 against the SP layers.</li>
                    <li>Example 2: on selection B there are £831 of backers' stakes and £4,428 of layers' liabilities at
                        SP and the following unmatched other Exchange lay bets, available to back: £20 at 6.8, £31.13 at
                        6.6 and £100 at 6.4. In this case the SP will be 6.68. This is calculated by including the £20
                        available to back at 6.8 and the £31.13 available to back at 6.6 and balancing those amounts
                        against the SP backers' stakes and SP layers' liabilities. The £100 available to back on the
                        Exchange at 6.4 remains unmatched as to include any of this amount would lead to an imbalance
                        between SP backers and SP layers.</li>
                    <li>The SP is calculated to six decimal places for each selection, though it may be displayed in the
                        relevant market view (or in any form/results data) to two decimal places, rounded up or down as
                        applicable. After reconciliation, the full SP on each selection is available by clicking on the
                        relevant individual runner graph.</li>
                    <li>If for whatever reason the site is unavailable when an event starts or the SP cannot otherwise
                        be reconciled at the 'off’, it will determine the SP using all available information. For the
                        avoidance of doubt this information will not be limited to betting activity on the relevant
                        market(s). Also in these circumstances, a licensed betting operator within the group may act as
                        risk counterparty to SP bets if necessary to ensure a fair SP. The personnel involved in
                        determining the SP in such circumstances will have no undeclared personal or other interest in
                        the SP in question.</li>
                    <li>If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken prematurely (for example if a horserace is turned
                        in-play in error), then it will endeavor to reverse the reconciliation so that the SP is
                        determined when the event starts. There may however be circumstances in which this is not
                        possible, in which case the SP will be based on the initial reconciliation.</li>
                    <li>In cases where an SP reconciliation is reversed: SP bets (including SP limit bets), 'At In-play:
                        Take SP' bets and 'At In-play: Keep' bets will all revert to their status before the
                        reconciliation; and 'At In-play: Cancel' bets will either remain cancelled if not matched as
                        part of the reconciliation process, or if matched as part of the reconciliation process, will
                        revert to their unmatched status before the reconciliation.</li>
                    <li>If the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than scheduled (i.e. after the event has
                        started) and determines that a material event has occurred (this will generally mean that the
                        event is not turned in-play), the SP will be determined based solely on SP bets (and ‘At
                        In-play: Take SP’ bets which are unmatched when suspends the relevant market), placed before the
                        'off'. This means that ‘At In-play: Take SP’ bets matched after the off, will be made void and
                        not included in the reconciliation process. In addition, SP bets placed after the 'off' will be
                        voided. However, if the SP reconciliation process is undertaken later than scheduled but
                        determines that no material event has occurred, all bets will stand.</li>
                    <li>If a SP 'each way' option is offered this will be processed as two separate bets: a win bet at
                        SP and a 'to be placed' bet at SP.</li>
                    <li>If for any reason unmatched bets are cancelled prior to a market going in-play, then any
                        unmatched bets that have been selected to 'At In-play: Take SP' will be converted to SP bets.
                        Once those bets are converted, they cannot be cancelled.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>➢ Party against whom you are betting at SP</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you place a bet at SP you are betting against other customers. However, during the
                        reconciliation of the SP, it acts as counterparty in order to balance liabilities between SP
                        bets and other Exchange bets</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>➢ Placing a SP bet</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Selecting the 'SP' button in the market view gives customers two different ways to request an SP
                        bet. These are as follows:</li>
                    <li>The first way to request a bet at SP is by leaving the 'Set SP odds limit' box unticked at the
                        top right of the bet manager. For a back bet you are required to enter the stake you wish to bet
                        on the selection. For a lay bet, you are required to enter the liability you are prepared to
                        risk against the selection – in other words the amount that you are prepared to lose, should the
                        selection win (or be placed as applicable).</li>
                    <li>The second way to request a bet at SP is to select the 'Set SP odds limit' option. Using this
                        you can request a bet at SP conditional upon minimum SP odds in the case of a back bet, or
                        maximum SP odds in the case of a lay bet. If SP is shorter than the minimum price requested by a
                        backer or is longer than the maximum price requested by a layer, then the relevant bet will
                        lapse when the event starts. If SP is longer than the minimum price requested by a backer or is
                        shorter than the maximum price requested by a layer, the bet will be matched at the SP. Where an
                        SP is equal to the price limit specified by customers, those bets will be included based on the
                        time they were submitted, on a first come, first served basis as is the existing convention for
                        other Exchange bets. This means that such bets may be unmatched or partially matched.</li>
                    <li>Please note that if a non-runner cannot be removed from the relevant market until after the
                        completion of the event, the application to all bets matched at or before the "off" (including
                        SP bets) of any reduction factor, may mean that the matched price for an SP back bet with an
                        odds limit requested, is adjusted to a price below the lower limit requested. It may also mean
                        that an SP lay bet request with maximum odds requested, may not be matched even though the odds
                        on the selection, after any post-race adjustment for the late non-runner, is below the maximum
                        odds requested.</li>
                    <li>If an SP bet with an odds limit is requested, the minimum/maximum odds requested can be
                        shortened in the case of a back bet or a lengthened in the case of a lay bet at any time before
                        the event starts. However, as mentioned above, an SP bet request cannot actually be cancelled by
                        a customer once it has been placed. Details of the impact of non-runners on the SP re provided
                        below.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>➢ Exchange bets which are unmatched at the 'off'</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A normal Exchange bet is placed by choosing the odds of your selection from the market view (as
                        opposed to clicking on the 'SP' of your selection). When such an Exchange bet is fully or
                        partially unmatched it can be adjusted and cancelled in the normal course. Previously, unmatched
                        bets were automatically cancelled when a market was suspended at the 'off' of the relevant
                        event. You can now choose to either have your unmatched Exchange bet convert to an SP bet when
                        the market suspends at the start of the event, or to have the bet 'persist' when the event goes
                        in-play (see the 'keep' option below).</li>
                    <li>In order to convert your unmatched Exchange bet to an SP bet when the market suspends you should
                        select the 'At In-Play: Take SP' option in the bet manager. If there is a non-runner in a win
                        market with a reduction factor of at least 2.5%, or a non-runner in a place market with a
                        reduction factor of at least 4%, it is policy to cancel unmatched lay bets on all other runners
                        in the market. In the case of any such non-runner, instead of being cancelled a lay bet for
                        which the 'At In-Play: Take SP' option has been selected, will automatically convert to an SP
                        bet. After this conversion, the bet cannot be cancelled. Otherwise, unlike an SP bet, you can
                        choose to cancel an Exchange bet once it has been placed, even if you have chosen for the bet to
                        persist or to convert to an SP bet at the start of the event.</li>
                    <li>If you choose to convert an unmatched Exchange lay bet to an SP bet, the liability of your
                        Exchange lay bet will be converted into a liability for the SP bet. Your liability for that SP
                        bet will never be more than the liability for the Exchange bet you had specified. However, the
                        amount you can win on the SP lay bet may differ from the amount you would have won had the
                        Exchange bet been matched, depending on the final SP.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>➢ Adjustments to SP bets for non-runners</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>For SP back bets, will at no point amend either the stake or the odds requested by a customer,
                        despite any non-runners or withdrawals. However, customers who have selected the SP limit option
                        can reduce the minimum SP odds they are prepared to accept on a selection.</li>
                    <li>For SP lay bets on win markets, it will reduce a customer's liability based on the reduction
                        factor(s) of any non-runner(s) and the reduction factor of the runner on which the customer's
                        bet has been placed. This is to ensure that the balance between the backers' stakes and the
                        layers' liability reflects the revised market after the runner has been removed. For example, if
                        a horse with a 50% reduction factor becomes a non-runner, then another horse in the same market
                        priced at about 5 (i.e. a reduction factor of 20%) will change to a price of about 2.5.
                        Therefore, the liability on a £200 lay bet on that runner will need to change to a liability of
                        about £75 to ensure that a balancing back bet will have the same £50 stake. This is done by
                        multiplying the liability by 37.5% (i.e. 100%-(50%/ (100%-20%))).</li>
                    <li>Where an SP lay bet in a win market has a maximum odds limit specified, this limit will be
                        reduced by the reduction factor of any non-runner, if the non-runner has a reduction factor of
                        at least 2.5%.</li>
                    <li>For SP lay bets on place markets, it will still reduce a customer's liability based on the
                        reduction factor(s) of any non-runner(s) but the calculation will be slightly different, in line
                        with the application of place market reduction factors. The liability will be reduced by the
                        reduction factor of the removed runner. Where the lay bet on a place market has a maximum odds
                        limit specified, the potential winnings on the bet (i.e. the odds – 1) will be reduced by the
                        reduction factor of the removed runner.</li>
                    <li>Where an SP lay bet in a place market has a maximum odds limit specified this limit will be
                        reduced by the reduction factor of any non-runner.</li>
                    <li>SP lay bets will not be cancelled when there is a non-runner.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>➢ Specific conditions for SP bets for non-runners in greyhound racing markets</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>ALL SP bets will stand so long as your trap selection is not vacant or after your bet placement
                        a reserve runner is not subsequently entered to run from your trap selection.</li>
                    <li>ALL unmatched ‘Convert to SP’ bets will be cancelled when a reserve is added or a vacant trap
                        removed.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>11. 'Keep' bets option</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>For markets that are scheduled to be turned in-play at the 'off', a customer can request that an
                        unmatched Exchange bet should not be cancelled when the market is turned in-play. This is done
                        by selecting the 'At In-Play: Keep' option in the bet manager (and confirming that request) and
                        means that the unmatched bet persists when other unmatched bets are cancelled at the start of
                        the event.</li>
                    <li>As described above, when a non-runner is removed from a horseracing market (apart for late
                        withdrawals as described in the next bullet point below), it is policy to cancel unmatched
                        offers to lay all other horses in the market if the non-runner has a reduction factor of 2.5% or
                        greater for win markets, or 4.0% or greater for place markets. In these circumstances offers to
                        lay a horse with the 'At In-Play: Keep' option selected will not be cancelled. Instead the lay
                        odds offered in place markets will be reduced in proportion with the reduction factors of any
                        non-runner(s) and the same will apply in win markets providing the relevant non-runner has a
                        reduction factor of at least 2.5%.</li>
                    <li>When there is a late withdrawal, may not have time to remove the non-runner from the market
                        before turning it in-play. In such cases if can determine that the late withdrawal is a material
                        runner (i.e. a selection with a reduction factor of approx. 20% or greater in the win market),
                        it reserves the right to cancel ALL lay 'keep' bets (in both the win and ‘to be placed’ markets)
                        before turning the market in-play. If it does not cancel lay 'keep' bets in the case of a late
                        withdrawal (for example, it may not be possible to know which horse is withdrawn, at the time of
                        the off), any such bets placed before the off and matched in-play will remain at the original
                        selected price. This means that those lay 'keep' bets will not be subject to any reduction
                        factor which as a result of the late withdrawal, will be applied after the completion of the
                        race to bets matched at or before the 'off'.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, in exceptional cases reserves the right to cancel 'keep' bets to protect customers
                        but, unless stipulated in the market rules or the market information, the general principle is
                        that at no point will a 'keep' bet be cancelled by unless it remains unmatched when the market
                        is closed (for the final time) at the end of the event.</li>
                    <li>For the avoidance of doubt this means that (for example) when a Material Event occurs in a
                        soccer match and other unmatched bets are cancelled before the market is reopened, a keep bet
                        will not be cancelled.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>12. Rules for Tote betting</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you place a Tote bet on the platform (for example a UK or South African Tote bet), you are
                        betting against as counterparty to your bet. I will then strike a corresponding bet into the
                        relevant Tote pool as applicable.</li>
                    <li>A link to the rules which apply to Tote bets struck as counterparty is provided within each of
                        the relevant. If there is any conflict between those rules and either: the equivalent rules
                        available on the relevant Tote website (for example on the UK Tote website in the case of UK
                        Tote bets); or the equivalent rules applied by the relevant host racetrack, the rules on the
                        relevant Tote website or applied by the relevant host racetrack, will prevail.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>13. Miscellaneous</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All references to time periods in the Exchange Rules relate to the time zone in which the event
                        takes place. For example, a reference to the start time of a football match, relates to the
                        local kick-off time.</li>
                    <li>All information is done so in good faith. However, it cannot accept liability for any errors or
                        omissions in respect of any information, such as the posting of prices, runners, times, scores,
                        results or general statistics. </li>
                    <li>It reserves the right to correct any obvious errors and shall take all reasonable steps to
                        ensure markets are administered with integrity and transparency.</li>
                    <li>If an incorrect team or competitor name is displayed (excluding minor spelling mistakes) or the
                        incorrect number of teams, competitors or outcomes is displayed in any complete market or a
                        market is otherwise loaded using incorrect information (for example the application of an
                        incorrect exposure algorithm or a cross matching tool utilising an incorrect algorithm) or
                        includes any obvious error such as the incorrect deployment of the cross matching tool, then It
                        reserves the right to suspend the market and (providing it acts reasonably) to void all bets
                        matched on the market.</li>
                    <li>Customers are responsible for ensuring that they satisfy themselves that the selection on which
                        they place a bet is their intended selection. For example, in the case of a competitor bearing
                        the same name as another individual not competing in the relevant event, the onus is on the
                        customer to ensure that they know which competitor It has loaded into the relevant market and to
                        ensure that they are placing their bet on their chosen competitor.</li>
                    <li>It reserves the right at any time in its sole and absolute discretion to suspend an Exchange
                        market.</li>
                    <li>It may, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide to suspend betting on a market at any time
                        (even if such suspension is earlier than anticipated by the Exchange Rules). In the interests of
                        maintaining integrity and fairness in the markets, it may also void certain bets in a market or
                        void a whole market in its entirety.</li>
                    <li>It reserves the right to amend the Exchange Rules at any time. </li>
                    <li>It reserves the right to cancel unmatched bets to protect customers at any time.</li>
                    <li>
                        On the settlement of any market, amounts relating to
                        <ul>
                            <li>winnings/losses on bets; and</li>
                            <li>commission charges</li>
                        </ul>
                        will be rounded up or down to the nearest two decimal places (with the exception that rounding
                        will always be down (and never up) in respect of amounts relating to winnings/losses in respect
                        of BSP bets). By way of example, £3.333, will be settled as £3.33, whereas £3.335, will be
                        settled as £3.34 (except that it will be settled as £3.33 in respect of an amount relating to
                        winnings/losses in respect of BSP bets).
                    </li>
                    <li>The Exchange Rules have been prepared in various languages other than English for reference
                        only. In the event of any differences between the English version and the non-English version,
                        the English version shall prevail.</li>

                        rounded up to give the applicable cumulative sum.</li>
                    <li>These markets are unaffected by any changes due to non-runners or reserve runners.</li>
                    <li>If a race is cancelled, void or abandoned or if there is only one finisher in a race, an eight
                        runner-greyhound races will be allocated 20 points and all other races will be allocated 12
                        points.</li>
                    <li>If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void however if at least one race has been
                        completed then bets on these markets will stand with the remaining races allocated 20 points for
                        eight runner greyhound races and 12 points for all other races.</li>
                    <li>Re-run races will be treated as cancelled races.</li>
                    <li>If there is a dead heat for the winner between two greyhounds then to calculate the applicable
                        multi-trap number for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the dead heat
                        will be multiplied by each other to give the applicable multi-trap number.</li>
                    <li>If there is a dead heat for the winner between three or more greyhounds then to calculate the
                        applicable multi-trap number for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the
                        dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of greyhounds involved in the dead heat and
                        the resulting number will be multiplied by itself to give the applicable multi-trap number (even
                        if not a round number). By way of example: traps 1, 3 and 6 dead heat for first. Add these
                        numbers up gives 10; divide this number by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat (3) which
                        gives a resulting number of 3.33; multiply 3.33 by itself to give 11.11.</li>
                    <li>If there is a dead heat for the runner up between two or more greyhounds then to calculate the
                        applicable multi-trap number for that race the trap numbers for the greyhounds involved in the
                        dead heat will be added up and divided by the number of greyhounds involved in the dead heat and
                        the resulting number will be multiplied by the number of the winner to give the applicable
                        multi-trap number (even if not a round number). By way of example: trap 1 wins and traps 3 and 6
                        dead heat for second. Adding the numbers of the dead heating runners up gives 9; divide this
                        number by the number of greyhounds in the dead heat (2) which gives a resulting number of 4.5;
                        multiple 4.5 by the winning number (1) to give 4.5.</li>

                        meeting, unless otherwise stated in the Market Information.</li>
                    <li>The maximum winning distance in any race is 10 lengths.</li>
                    <li>If there is only one finisher in any race the winning distance will be deemed to be 10 lengths.
                    </li>

                    <li>For distances below half a length, the following scale will be applied: Short-head 0.1; Head
                        0.2; Neck 0.3.</li>
                    <li>The sum of all the winning distances will be rounded to the nearest whole number at the end of
                        the meeting (rounded up, if half) and bets will be settled on this result.</li>
                    <li>If a whole meeting is abandoned all bets are void. However, if at least one race has been
                        completed then the remaining races are allocated 2 lengths each and bets will stand.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>'Match Bets' for a race are determined by the greyhound with the highest finishing position in
                        that race. If neither greyhound finishes the race bets are void. If only one of the greyhounds
                        finishes the race, that greyhound will be deemed the winner. If a non-runner or reserve runner
                        is declared then all bets will be void.</li>
                    <li>'Match Bets' for progress in a competition are determined by the greyhound which qualifies to
                        the furthest round (whether it runs in the further round or not). If the greyhounds concerned
                        fail to qualify in the same round of the competition then the market will be settled as a dead
                        heat, irrespective of their finishing positions in their individual heats.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If a greyhound listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the available information to
                        determine the time of the greyhound's death. It will then, acting reasonably, determine whether
                        the greyhound was a 'material runner' in the market. In determining whether a greyhound is a
                        material runner, it will look at the general price of the greyhound immediately before the
                        greyhound's death, in the market and in the wider betting market. Broadly, it will consider a
                        greyhound to be a material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate chance of winning of
                        8-10 per cent or better.</li>
                    <li>If It determines that the greyhound was a 'material runner', then all bets struck in the market
                        (on all selections) between the time of death and the suspension of the market will be void and
                        all unmatched bets will be cancelled before the market is reopened.</li>
                    <li>If It determines that the greyhound was not a 'material runner', then just bets struck on the
                        greyhound in question between the time of death and the suspension of the market will be void
                        and unmatched bets will not be cancelled before the market is reopened.</li>
                    <li>Bets matched on greyhounds after they have forfeited their entry at a particular entry stage or
                        where they have not qualified by the applicable qualifying date will be voided unless the race
                        in question has a subsequent supplementary entry stage.</li>
                    <li>Where an event is postponed or rescheduled to another day at the same venue then ante-post bets

                        Australian greyhound markets.</li>
                    <li>If a greyhound becomes a notified non-runner after the market is loaded but prior to the
                        commencement of the race it will be removed and all bets on the market, matched prior to the
                        update of the market will be voided.</li>
                    <li>If, following the completion of a race, the stewards declare a greyhound a non-runner, it will
                        resettle the market and will void all bets that were placed on that runner only. It will then
                        apply a reduction factor to all bets placed on the winner (or place getters in the case of place
                        markets) based on that runner’s weighted average price.</li>

                    <li>For GB and Irish racing: if a horse is balloted out, all bets on that horse will be void.</li>
                    <li>If a horse listed in an ante-post market dies, it will use the available information to
                        determine the time of the horse's death. It will be acting reasonably, determine whether the
                        horse was a 'material runner' in the market. It will undertake a similar determination in cases
                        where it is advised through official channels that a runner has been formally scratched from an
                        ante-post race. In determining whether a horse is a material runner, it will consider the
                        general price of the horse immediately before the horse's death (or immediately before being
                        advised it has been scratched), in the market and in the wider betting market. Broadly, it will
                        consider a horse to be a material runner if it is deemed to have an approximate chance of
                        winning of 8-10 per cent or better.</li>

                        was created) and the suspension of the market will be void and all unmatched bets will be

                    <li>For example: “EW Terms: 1/5th odds, 3 places”. That “1/5th” is applied to the traditional or
                        fractional odds, which are 1 less than decimal odds, so the calculation of the Place odds
                        corresponding to Win odds of 8.0 in this market is ((8.0 – 1) / 5) + 1 = 2.4.</li>
                    <li>Once opened, the number of places in 'EW” markets will not be affected by further non-runners
                        unless the number of ‘places’ which are offered on the ‘Each Way’ market is equal to or exceeds
                        the number of runners in which case, the place portion of any EW bet will be voided at

                        because: (i) of an incorrect weight carried; (ii) they have taken the wrong course; (iii) the
                        jockey of either horse fails to weigh in, or weighs in light after the race; then in each case
                        the winning distance shall be that between the first and second horse under the official result.

                    <li>
                        For the purpose of this bet, the maximum distance on any individual race will be 12 lengths for
                        Flat races and 30 lengths for National Hunt races (which includes National Hunt Flat Races) and
                        these distances will be applied where only one horse finishes a race. For distances below half a

                <h4>➢ Non-Runner Rule</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Non-runner rule relates to the adjustment of odds on bets already matched when a horse in a race
                        is declared a non-runner. In order to make the adjustment applies a reduction factor to the
                        remaining runners. The reduction factor allocated to a non-runner is a calculation (the details
                        of which are described below) of that horse's chances of winning (or being placed, etc. as
                        appropriate) and is applied to bets already matched on the other runners in the relevant market
                        or markets.</li>
                    <li>Any horse listed when the relevant market is loaded which does not subsequently come under
                        starter's orders is deemed to be a non-runner.</li>
                    <li>When the market is loaded each horse is given a 'reduction factor', based on a forecast price,
                        which is expressed as a percentage. These reduction factors may be updated periodically at the
                        discretion based on trading in the market, but after approximately 15 minutes (approximately 5
                        minutes for Australian and US markets) from the scheduled 'off' time of a given race, they will
                        be updated only in exceptional circumstances.</li>
                    <li>Reductions will be made to both win and place markets but applied differently (as described
                        below), and horses will have a different reduction factor for each market.</li>
                    <li>As soon as becomes aware that a horse is an official non-runner or a highly likely non-runner,
                        following a statement to the press from connections, the following will happen:</li>
                    <li>All matched bets on that horse will be void and the horse will be removed from the market.</li>
                    <li>In the win market: if the reduction factor of the non-runner is 2.5% or greater, the traded
                        price of all the matched bets on the remaining horses will be reduced by an amount equal to the
                        non-runner's final reduction factor and all the unmatched offers to lay will be cancelled. If
                        the non-runner's reduction factor is less than 2.5%, reductions will not be applied and
                        unmatched bets will not be cancelled.</li>
                    <li>In the place market, the reduction factor of all non-runners will be applied (even if less than
                        2.5%) and the potential winnings in relation to matched bets on the remaining horses will be
                        reduced by an amount equal to the non-runner's final reduction factor. Only if the non-runner's
                        reduction factor is 4.0% or greater will all the unmatched offers to lay be cancelled.</li>
                    <li>All the reduction factors on the remaining horses will be adjusted to reflect their improved
                        chance of winning.</li>
                    <li>Reduction factors are not applied to bets which are struck in-play. However, if a market is
                        turned in-play prematurely by error (or, for example, there is a false start), all bets matched
                        during this time will be subject to any later reduction factor, provided the market is turned
                        out of play before the race commences. In the event of a late withdrawal, it reserves the right
                        to remove the runner after completion of the race. In this case only those bets matched prior to
                        the off will be affected by a reduction factor.</li>
                    <li>In the event of a non-runner being removed from a race in error or following incorrect
                        information regarding a runner’s participation, it will reinstate both the runner and all
                        previously matched bets associated with that runner. All bets made between the time of
                        withdrawal and reinstatement will be void in both the place market and the win market. The
                        reduction factor applied to matched bets at the time of withdrawal will be reversed and the
                        original prices will become valid.</li>
                    <li>Any non-runners will be removed from the relevant markets in the order in which they are brought
                        to attention. If It becomes aware of more than one non-runner at the same time, it will remove
                        the non-runners from the relevant markets in race card order.</li>
                    <li>If a runner is not included in a market because of an error or because of incorrect information
                        regarding a runner’s participation, It reserve the right to introduce the missing runner into
                        the market at any time prior to settlement (even after the race has been run), provided that It
                        has determined that the missing runner is not a material runner (i.e. a selection with a
                        reduction factor of approx. 2.5% or less in the win market). In such circumstances, all pre-play
                        unmatched and matched bets will stand, however if the runner is not introduced before the start
                        of the race, all in-play bets will be void. However, if the missing runner is deemed to be a
                        material runner, then the malformed market will be void and a new market will be loaded where
                        possible.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>➢ How the Reductions are applied for Exchange markets</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the win market, reductions will be made on the traded price.</li>
                    <li>For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the traded price on all
                        previously matched bets on other horses will be reduced by 25% - traded price of 8.0 would
                        become 6.0 etc. And these might be further reduced if another horse is subsequently declared a
                        non-runner.</li>
                    <li>In the EW Market, reductions will be made on the traded win price. The advertised place terms
                        will then apply to the revised win prices.</li>
                    <li>For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the traded price on all
                        previously matched bets on other horses will be reduced by 25% - - traded price of 8.0 would
                        become 6.0. If each Way terms were 1/5th odds for 3 places, the corresponding price for the
                        Place portion of the bet would reduce from 2.4 to 2.0.</li>
                    <li>In the place market, reductions will be made to the potential winnings on the bet only, and not
                        the traded price.</li>
                    <li>For example: if the non-runner's final reduction factor is 25% the potential winnings on all
                        previously matched bets on the other horses will be reduced by 25% - a traded price of 8.0 would
                        become 6.25. For example, a £10 bet on a horse to be placed at a traded price of 8.0 would
                        provide winnings of £70. If there is a non-runner with a reduction factor of 25% in the race,
                        that factor will be applied to the £70 of potential winnings leaving potential winnings of
                        £52.50. Therefore, the revised traded price will be 6.25.</li>
                    <li>The traded price may be further reduced if any other horse(s) is subsequently declared a
                        non-runner, however odds cannot be reduced below 1.01.</li>
                    <li>Reserves: A reserve runner may appear in the relevant markets but will have a non-applicable
                        reduction factor until It has received confirmation that it is a confirmed runner, in which case
                        an applicable reduction factor may apply to it.</li>
                    <li>For the avoidance of doubt, any reduction factor applicable to a non-runner replaced by a
                        reserve, will be applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from
                        those markets of such non-runner. Likewise, should a reserve runner become a confirmed runner
                        but subsequently become a non-runner, any reduction factor applicable to such non-runner will be
                        applied to all bets struck on the relevant markets, prior to the removal from those markets of
                        such non-runner.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>➢ Additional rules</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card numbers are posted as a guide only: bets are placed on a named horse.</li>
                    <li>Horses will not be coupled.</li>
                    <li>Where any horse(s) runs for purse money only it is deemed a non-runner for betting purposes.
                        Should this result in the number of possible winners stated in the relevant Market Information
                        being equal to or greater than the number of runners in the relevant market, all bets in the
                        market will be void.</li>

                    <li>'Puck Line' markets (i.e. handicap markets for NHL (National Hockey League) matches) will be
                        settled on the final result including any overtime and any shootouts that may be played. All

                    <li>If a match starts but is later abandoned or postponed then, within three days of the scheduled
                        start date, (a) at least 55 minutes of play must have elapsed in any match; or (b) an official

                    <li>'Tournament points' and 'tournament tries' bets will apply to all playing time, including any
                        extra-time in any match where an official result is declared.</li>
                    <li>For 'time of first try' bets, if the try is scored in the second half, the first half is deemed
                        to have lasted 40 minutes, regardless of stoppage-time. If no try is scored, or the try is
                        scored in second half stoppage-time or extra-time, the result is 80.</li>
                    <li>For the purpose of markets involving tries, penalty tries will count with the exception of
                        'first individual try scorer' markets where penalty tries will not count.</li>
                    <li>If a match starts but is abandoned before its completion, all bets will be void unless an
                        official result is declared by the applicable governing body. Where an official result has been
                        declared by the official governing body, that official result will govern match and handicap
                        market settlement but all other markets will be void unless their result has already been
                        determined at the point of abandonment (i.e. at the point of abandonment, it would not have been
                        possible for the outcome of the bet to change had the match continued to its natural
                        conclusion). By way of example, if 37 points have been scored at the time a match is abandoned:
                        (i) a bet placed on 35 points or more to be scored would be settled as a winning bet, (ii) a bet
                        placed on 30-35 points to be scored would be settled as a losing bet and (iii) a bet placed on
                        40-45 points to be scored would be void. In such circumstances, bets on last try scorer / team
                        to score last / team to score last try / last scoring play would all be void.</li>

                        reserves, age group, gender, etc.), then all bets matched on the affected markets will be void.
                        In all other cases, bets will stand (including instances where a team name is listed without
                        specifying the term 'XI' in the name). If an official fixture is shown on the website under an
                        incorrect competition name, then it reserves the right to void all bets matched on the affected
                        markets.</li>
                    <li>If a team is relegated from a league because, at the end of a season, it has finished within the
                        relegation positions which are relevant to that league (i.e. usually any of the bottom three
                        league positions), bets on that team to be relegated will be settled as winning bets. If a team
                        is otherwise disqualified, thrown out or removed from a league (i.e. in circumstances other than
                        those where it has finished the season within the relevant relegation positions): (i) if such
                        team is disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league before the relevant season has
                        started, all bets on the affected market will be void (and a new market will subsequently be
                        loaded) and (ii) if such team is disqualified, thrown out or removed from the league after the
                        relevant season has started (or a determination is made by the applicable governing body, during
                        the season, that the team will be thrown out or removed from the league following the season’s
                        conclusion), all bets on the affected team will be void. For the avoidance of doubt, if a points
                        deduction is imposed on a team such that it finishes the season within the relegation places
                        which are relevant to the applicable league, bets on that team to be relegated will be settled
                        as winning bets.</li>
                    <li>The relevant season will be deemed to have started once the first league game has been played.
                        For the purposes of this rule, markets relating to individual matches will not be deemed to be
                        "affected markets".</li>
                    <li>'Shirt numbers' bets will refer to the shirt number allocated at the start of the match. 'Shirt
                        numbers' bets will include own-goal scorers. Any player whose shirt bears no number will be
                        allocated the number 12.</li>
                    <li>For 'time of first goal' bets (i.e. "First Goal Odds" markets), the first half is deemed to last
                        45 minutes, regardless of stoppage time. Also for these markets, please note that the "0 - 10
                        Minutes" selection covers the first 10 minutes of the match. In other words, it runs from 0:00
                        until just before the clock hits 10:00. The "11 – 20 Minutes" selection runs from 10:00 until
                        just before the clock hits 20:00. The same principle applies to each of the other selections in
                        this market.</li>
                    <li>For 'top goal scorer' markets only the goals scored in the league or competition stated in the
                        Market Information count. For example, if a player joins a club mid-season any goals scored in a
                        different league will not count, however goals scored for a different club in the same league
                        will count. Own goals will not count.</li>
                    <li>In markets which relate to the number of incidents to occur, such as 'number of corners', these
                        will be determined on the basis of the number taken, rather than awarded.</li>
                    <li>For markets that relate to the number of bookings given, the number of corners taken, any goal
                        scorer or the time of a particular goal, the result will be determined (acting reasonably) using
                        information from independent sources. In such cases, if any new information comes into the
                        public domain within 48 hours of settlement, then it shall (acting reasonably) determine either:
                        (i) whether the market should be reinstated or resettled in light of this new information; or
                        (ii) to wait for further information before deciding whether to reinstate or resettle the
                        market. Except it has announced that it is waiting for further information, any information that
                        comes into the public domain more than 48 hours after a market has been settled shall not be
                        considered (regardless of whether or not such information may have led to a different result).

                    obligations already matured will however be honoured.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to refuse, restrict, cancel or limit any wager at any time for whatever reason,
                    including any bet perceived to be placed in a fraudulent manner in order to circumvent our betting
                    limits and/ or our system regulations.</p>
                <p>If we close or suspend your account due to you not complying with these terms, we may cancel and/or
                    void any of your bets.</p>

                    of any such mistake, we shall notify you and the amount will be withdrawn from your Account.</p>

                    received from the Customer’s Registered Email Address and have to be sent to
                    support@{{fullSiteName}}.</p>
                <p>Customers may set limitations on the amount they may wager and lose. Such request has to be sent from

                    Address to support@{{fullSiteName}}.</p>
                <p>6. <u>Deposit of Funds</u></p>
                <p>You may deposit funds into your Account by any of the methods set out on our Website. All deposits
                    should be made in the same currency as your Account and any deposits made in any other currency will
                    be converted using the daily exchange rate obtained from www.oanda.com, or at our own bank’s
                    prevailing rate of exchange following which your Account will be deposited accordingly.</p>
                <p>Fees and charges may apply to customer’s deposits and withdrawals. Any deposit made to an account
                    which is not rolled over (risked) three times will incur a 3% processing fee and any applicable
                    withdrawal fee. You are responsible for your own bank charges that you may incur due to depositing
                    funds with us. Exceptions to this rule are outlined in our “Payment Options” pages.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} is not a financial institution and uses a third party electronic payment processors to
                    process credit and debit card deposits; they are not processed directly by us. If you deposit funds
                    by either a credit card or a debit card, your Account will only be credited if we receive an
                    approval and authorisation code from the payment issuing institution. If your card’s issuer gives no
                    such authorisation, your account will not be credited with those funds.</p>
                <p>Your funds are deposited and held in the respective client account based on the currency of your
                    account.</p>
                <p>We are not a financial institution and you will not be entitled to any interest on any outstanding
                    account balances and any interest accrued on the client accounts will be paid to us.</p>
                <p>Funds originating from ill-gotten means must not be deposited with us.</p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>7. <u>Withdrawal of Funds</u></p>
                <p>You may withdraw any or all of your account Balance within the transaction.</p>
                <p>Note that fees may apply as outlined in section 7.b.</p>
                <p>All withdrawals must be made in the currency of your account, unless otherwise stipulated by us.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to request documentation for the purpose of identity verification prior to
                    granting any withdrawals from your Account. We also reserve our rights to request this documentation
                    at any time during the lifetime of your relationship with us.</p>
                <p>All withdrawals must be made to the original debit, credit card, bank account, method of payment used
                    to make the payment to your {{fullSiteName}} Account. We may, and always at our own discretion,
                    allow
                    you to withdraw to a payment method from which your original deposit did not originate. This will
                    always be subject to additional security checks.</p>
                <p>Should you wish to withdraw funds but your account is either inaccessible, dormant, locked or closed,
                    please contact our Customer Service Department at support@{{fullSiteName}}</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>8. <u>Payment Transactions and Processors</u></p>
                <p>You are fully responsible for paying all monies owed to us. You must make all payments to us in good
                    faith and not attempt to reverse a payment made or take any action which will cause such payment to
                    be reversed by a third party in order to avoid a liability legitimately incurred. You will reimburse
                    us for any charge-backs, denial or reversal of payment you make and any loss suffered by us as a
                    consequence thereof. We reserve the right to also impose an administration fee of €60, or currency
                    equivalent per charge-back, denial or reversal of payment you make.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to use third party electronic payment processors and or merchant banks to
                    process payments made by you and you agree to be bound by their terms and conditions providing they
                    are made aware to you and those terms do not conflict with these Terms.</p>
                <p>All transactions made on our site might be checked to prevent money laundering or terrorism financing
                    activity. Suspicious transactions will be reported to the relevant authority depending on the
                    jurisdiction governing the transaction.</p>
                <p>9. <u>Errors</u></p>
                <p>In the event of an error or malfunction of our system or processes, all bets are rendered void. You
                    are under an obligation to inform us immediately as soon as you become aware of any error with the
                    service. In the event of communication or system errors or bugs or viruses occurring in connection
                    with the service and/or payments made to you as a result of a defect or effort in the Service, we
                    will not be liable to you or to any third party for any direct or indirect costs, expenses, losses
                    or claims arising or resulting from such errors, and we reserve the right to void all games/bets in
                    question and take any other action to correct such errors.</p>
                <p>In the event of a casino system malfunction, or disconnection issues, all bets are rendered void. In
                    the event of such error or any system failure or game error that results in an error in any odds
                    calculation, charges, fees, rake, bonuses or payout, or any currency conversion as applicable, or
                    other casino system malfunction (the “Casino Error”), we reserve the right to declare null and void
                    any wagers or bets that were the subject of such Casino Error and to take any money from your
                    Account relating to the relevant bets or wagers.</p>
                <p>We make every effort to ensure that we do not make errors in posting lines. However, if as a result
                    of human error or system problems a bet is accepted at an odd that is: materially different from
                    those available in the general market at the time the bet was made; or clearly incorrect given the
                    chance of the event occurring at the time the bet was made then we reserve the right to cancel or
                    void that wager, or to cancel or void a wager made after an event has started.</p>
                <p>We have the right to recover from you any amount overpaid and to adjust your account to rectify any
                    mistake. An example of such a mistake might be where a price is incorrect or where we enter a result
                    of an event incorrectly. If there are insufficient funds in your Account, we may demand that you pay
                    us the relevant outstanding amount relating to any erroneous bets or wagers. Accordingly, we reserve
                    the right to cancel, reduce or delete any pending plays, whether placed with funds resulting from
                    the error or not.</p>
                <p>10. <u>General Rules</u></p>
                <p>If a sport-specific rule contradicts a general rule, then the general rule will not apply.</p>
                <p>The winner of an event will be determined on the date of the event’s settlement; we do not recognise
                    protested or overturned decisions for wagering purposes. The result of an event suspended after the
                    start of competition will be decided according to the wagering rules specified for that sport by us.
                </p>
                <p>All results posted shall be final after 72 hours and no queries will be entertained after that period
                    of time. Within 72 hours after results are posted, the company will only reset/correct the results
                    due to human error, system error or mistakes made by the referring results source.</p>
                <p>Minimum and maximum wager amounts on all sporting events will be determined by us and are subject to
                    change without prior written notice. We also reserve the right to adjust limits on individual
                    Accounts as well.</p>
                <p>Customers are solely responsible for their own account transactions. Please be sure to review your
                    wagers for any mistakes before sending them in. Once a transaction is complete, it cannot be
                    changed. We do not take responsibility for missing or duplicate wagers made by the Customer and will
                    not entertain discrepancy requests because a play is missing or duplicated. Customers may review
                    their transactions in the My Account section of the site after each session to ensure all requested
                    wagers were accepted.</p>
                <p>For a wager to have action on any named contestant in a Yes/No Proposition, the contestant must enter
                    and compete in the event.</p>
                <p>We attempt to follow the normal conventions to indicate home and away teams by indicating the home
                    and away team by means of vertical placement on the desktop site version. This means in American
                    Sports we would place the home team on the bottom. For Non-US sports, we would indicate the home
                    team on top. In the case of a neutral venue, we attempt to include the letter “N” next to the team
                    names to indicate this. For the Asian and mobile versions, we do not distinguish between European
                    and American Sports. On the Asian and mobile versions of the site, the home team is always listed
                    first. However, we do not guarantee the accuracy of this information and unless there is an official
                    venue change subsequent to bets being placed, all wagers have action.</p>
                <p>A game/match will have action regardless of the League heading that is associated with the matchup.
                    For example, two teams from the same League are playing in a Cup competition. If the matchup is
                    mistakenly placed in the League offering, the game/match will still have action, as long as the
                    matchup is correct. In other words, a matchup will have action as long as the two teams are correct,
                    and regardless of the League header in which it is placed on our Website.</p>
                <p>If an event is not played on the same date as announced by the governing body, then all wagers on the
                    event have no action. If an event is posted by us, with an incorrect date, all wagers have action
                    based on the date announced by the governing body.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} reserves the right to remove events, markets and any other product from the website.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} reserves the right to restrict the casino access of any player without prior notice.</p>
                <p>In all futures wagering (for example, total season wins, Super Bowl winner, etc.), the winner as
                    determined by the Governing Body will also be declared the winner for betting purposes except when
                    the minimum number of games required for the future to have “action” has not been completed.</p>
                <p>11. <u>Communications and Notices</u></p>
                <p>All communications and notices to be given under these terms by you to us shall be sent to
                    support@{{siteName}}com</p>
                <p>All communications and notices to be given under these terms by us to you shall, unless otherwise
                    specified in these terms, be either posted on the Website and/or sent to the Registered Email
                    Address we hold on our system for the relevant Customer. The method of such communication shall be
                    in our sole and exclusive discretion.</p>
                <p>All communications and notices to be given under these terms by either you or us shall be in writing
                    in the English language when the service is not operated by {{siteName}}, and must be given to and
                    from the Registered Email Address in your Account.</p>
                <p>12. <u>Matters Beyond Our Control</u></p>
                <p>We cannot be held liable for any failure or delay in providing the service due to an event of Force
                    Majeure which could reasonably be considered to be outside our control despite our execution of
                    reasonable preventative measures such as: an act of God; trade or labour dispute; power cut; act,
                    failure or omission of any government or authority; obstruction or failure of telecommunication
                    services; or any other delay or failure caused by a third party, and we will not be liable for any
                    resulting loss or damage that you may suffer. In such an event, we reserve the right to cancel or
                    suspend the Service without incurring any liability.</p>

                        keeping, and reportable transactions, who need enough information to process and complete a
                        transaction properly as well as to ascertain the identity of customers and keep records as
                        required. </li>
                    <li>Policies and procedures which incorporate the reporting, record keeping, customer
                        identification, risk assessment and risk mitigation requirements applicable.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although directors and senior officers may not be involved in day-to-day compliance, they need to
                    understand the statutory duties placed upon them, their staff and {{siteName}} itself.</p>
                <p>15.4.1 <u>The Risk-Based Approach</u></p>
                <p>In money laundering and terrorist financing, a risk-based approach covers the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The risk assessment of customer relationships and business activities;</li>
                    <li>The risk mitigation to implement controls to handle identified risks;</li>
                    <li>Keeping customer identification, beneficial ownership and business relationship information up
                        to date; and</li>
                    <li>The ongoing monitoring of business relationships and transactions.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Existing regulatory obligations, such as for customer identification, are a minimum baseline
                    requirement. Where enhanced due diligence is appropriate, a principle of the risk-based approach is
                    to focus resources where they are most needed to manage risks within our tolerance level.</p>
                <p>15.4.2 <u>Risk Mitigation</u></p>
                <p>Risk mitigation is implementing controls to limit the potential money laundering and terrorist
                    financing risks identified in the risk assessment so as to stay within the risk tolerance level.
                    When the risk assessment determines that risk is high for money laundering or terrorist financing,
                    then we will develop risk mitigation strategies and apply them.</p>
                <p>In all situations, risk mitigation controls and measures include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Focussing on operations (products and services, customers and business relationships, geographic
                        locations, and any other relevant factors) that are more vulnerable to abuse by money launderers
                        and criminals;</li>
                    <li>Informing senior management of compliance initiatives, identified compliance deficiencies,
                        corrective action taken, and suspicious transaction reports filed;</li>
                    <li>Providing for program continuity despite changes in management, employees or structure;</li>
                    <li>Focussing on meeting all regulatory record keeping and reporting requirements, recommendations
                        for anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance and providing for timely
                        updates in response to changes in requirements;</li>
                    <li>Enabling the timely identification of reportable transactions and ensure accurate filing of
                        required reports;</li>
                    <li>Incorporating anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing compliance into job
                        descriptions and performance evaluations of appropriate personnel; and</li>
                    <li>Providing for adequate supervision and training of employees that handle currency transactions,
                        complete reports, monitor for suspicious transactions, or engage in any other activity that
                        forms part of the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing program.</li>
                    <li>Increasing awareness of high risk situations within all business lines;</li>
                    <li>Increasing the frequency of ongoing monitoring of transactions or business relationships;</li>
                    <li>Escalating the approval of the establishment of an account or relationship even if not otherwise
                        required to do so;</li>
                    <li>Increasing the levels of ongoing controls and reviews of relationships;</li>
                    <li>Requesting high-risk customers provide additional, documented information regarding controls
                        they have implemented to safeguard their operations from abuse by money launderers and
                        terrorists;</li>
                    <li>Verifying the identity of customers by reference to reliable, independent source documents, data

                    <li>Preventing any transaction with a potential customer until identification and account opening
                        information has been obtained;</li>

                        of the customer acceptance process or declining to do business with potential customers because

                <p>15.4.3 <u>Risk Assessment</u></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} is required to and will analyse potential threats and vulnerabilities to money
                    laundering
                    and terrorist financing to which the business may be exposed to in a risk assessment.</p>
                <p>The risk assessment will document and consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Products, services and delivery channels</li>
                    <li>Geographic locations and areas of operation </li>
                    <li>Customers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The risk assessment may identify high-risk situations for which risk mitigation controls and
                    monitoring may be required. The risk assessment is not static and will change over time.</p>
                <p>When a customer is identified as high-risk, they are subject to more frequent ongoing monitoring and
                    updating of customer identification information, as well as any other appropriate enhanced measures.
                </p>
                <p>{{siteName}} shall perform an initial risk assessment at the beginning of a new customer relationship
                    and for existing customers on an ongoing basis.</p>
                <p>15.5 <u>Client and Business Risk</u></p>
                <p>15.5.1 <u>Products, Services and Delivery Channels</u></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} will identify products and services or combinations of them that may pose an elevated
                    risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. For example, products and services that support the
                    movement and conversion of assets into, through and out of the financial system pose a high risk.
                    Certain services have also been identified by financial regulators, governmental authorities or
                    other credible sources as being potentially high-risk for money laundering or terrorist financing.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wire transactions;</li>
                    <li>Transactions involving third parties;</li>
                    <li>Non-face-to-face business relationships.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>15.5.2 <u>Geographic Locations and Areas of Operation</u></p>
                <p>Certain geographic locations potentially pose an elevated risk for money laundering and terrorist
                    financing. These have been described by the FATF and by other resources such as Transparency
                    International. </p>
                <p>Clients from, or identified as linked to these countries will be regarded as high risk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any country subject to sanctions, embargoes, or similar measures;</li>
                    <li>Any country identified by credible sources as providing funding or support for terrorist
                        activities, or that have designated terrorist organisations operating within their country;</li>
                    <li>Any country known to be a tax haven, source of narcotics or other significant criminal activity;
                    </li>
                    <li>Any country identified by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as non-cooperative in the fight
                        against money laundering or terrorist financing or subject to a FATF statement;</li>
                    <li>Any country identified by credible sources as lacking appropriate money laundering or terrorist
                        financing laws and regulations, or as having significant levels of corruption.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>{{siteName}} does not do business with or provide services to anyone in any country belonging to a
                    list of select countries subject to comprehensive international sanctions.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p></p>

                <p>15.5.3 <u>Customer Relationships</u></p>
                <p>The risk assessment requires to know your customers (“KYC”). This is not limited to identification or
                </p>
                <p>record keeping, but it is also about understanding the customers – including their activities,</p>
                <p>transaction patterns, and how they operate. </p>
                <p>Examples of the factors that will be considered are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How long we have known the customer and had a business relationship;</li>
                    <li>Customers wanting to carry out large transactions;</li>
                    <li>Customers with regulatory or enforcement issues;</li>
                    <li>Customers with multiple online complaints;</li>
                    <li>Customers whose identification is difficult to verify;</li>
                    <li>Customers whose who are politically exposed. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each customer is risk-rated as either posing a low, medium or high risk of money laundering and/or
                </p>
                <p>terrorist financing. The rating given at the beginning of the business relationship may be adjusted
                </p>
                <p>after the re-assessment and may change over time. The level of customer due diligence will vary</p>
                <p>depending on the risk rating of the customer at the beginning of the relationship and as it changes.
                </p>
                <p>For all high-risk players, enhanced due diligence is applied right away.</p>

                <p>15.5.4 <u>Regulatory risk</u></p>
                <p>Regulatory risk means not meeting our obligations under applicable legislation. Examples of breaches
                    of regulatory obligations include:</p>

                <p>Customer identification not done properly;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Failure to train staff adequately;<p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Bot having an anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) program;<p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Failure to report suspicious transactions;<p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Not having an MLRO;<p></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Failing to keep complete customer records.<p></p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>15.5 <u>Compliance Training</u></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} has a training program for all relevant employees and other individuals who act on
                    behalf
                    of the Company. The goal of this training is to make sure that those who have contact with
                    customers, who see customer transaction activity or who handle funds in any way understand the
                    reporting, customer identification and record keeping requirements.</p>
                <p>All new employees of {{siteName}} are required to complete anti-money laundering and terrorist
                    financing compliance training within their first three months of employment, and for customer-facing
                    staff training is delivered prior to dealing with customers.</p>
                <p>Training is currently conducted through a customised course. The training program is delivered
                    electronically (via a learning management system). The training program is reviewed and updated by
                    the MLRO to reflect requirements as they change. The compliance training includes a test which
                    everyone must pass in order to consider their training complete.</p>
                <p>To ensure employee training is kept up to date, all existing employees will receive follow up
                    training on new and existing AML and regulatory requirements on a regular basis (at least within one
                    year of their last training). If the online training test results show that a staff member does not
                    understanding the training material, {{siteName}} will ensure that the staff member receives
                    specialised one-on-one training to understand the material.</p>
                <p>An employee log of assigned and completed training materials is kept by the MLRO and the Human
                    Resources department for administrative purposes. Retention of these records is for a period of five
                    years.</p>
                <p>Compliance training is adjusted in accordance to the employee’s role within the company. The MLRO
                    will review functions and arrange to provide suitable and customised training.</p>
                <p>Our training will include at a minimum:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An understanding of the reporting, customer identification and record keeping requirements as
                        well as penalties for not meeting those requirements;</li>
                    <li>Making all employees aware of the internal policies and procedures for deterring and detecting
                        money laundering and terrorist financing that are associated with their jobs;</li>
                    <li>Delivering to employees and suppliers a clear understanding of their responsibilities under
                        these policies and procedures;</li>
                    <li>All those who have contact with customers, who see customer transaction activity, who handle
                        cash or funds in any way or who are responsible for implementing or overseeing the compliance
                        regime must understand the reporting, customer identification and record keeping requirements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Making all employees aware of how {{siteName}} is vulnerable to abuse by criminals laundering
                        the
                        proceeds of crime or by terrorists financing their activities;</li>
                    <li>Making all employees and agents aware that they cannot disclose that they have made a suspicious
                        transaction report, or disclose the contents of such a report, with the intent to prejudice a
                        criminal investigation, whether it has started or not;</li>
                    <li>That all employees and agents understanding that no criminal or civil proceedings may be brought
                        against them for making a report in good faith;</li>
                    <li>Background information on money laundering so everyone who needs to can understand what money
                        laundering is, why criminals choose to launder money and how the process usually works;</li>
                    <li>Details of what terrorist financing is and how that process usually works.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The MLRO is responsible for ensuring that everyone is informed of changes in anti-money laundering or
                    anti-terrorist financing legislation, policies and procedures, and current developments in money
                    laundering or terrorist activity financing schemes particularly relevant to their jobs.</p>
                <p>Certain employees, such as those in compliance, customer services and operations, require types of
                    specialised additional training which will be provided either through external services or
                    internally. The training program is reviewed and updated to reflect changes in requirements.</p>
                <p>15.6. <u>Minimum standards – KYC POLICY</u></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} has established standards regarding Know-Your-Customer (“KYC”). These standards require
                    due diligence on each prospective customer before entering into a business relationship via
                    identification and verification of his identity and, as the case may be, his representatives and
                    beneficial owners on the basis of documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and
                    independent source compliant with the domestic and European AML/CFT legislation and regulation.</p>
                <p>Interpretation of the KYC principle begins with identification of the customer by means of the
                    necessary identification documents.</p>
                <p>That identification, completed by other information gathered, enables the Customer Acceptance Policy
                    to be applied.</p>
                <p>In addition to these objective criteria, there are subjective elements which may arouse suspicions
                    regarding a customer and to which particular attention should be paid.</p>
                <p>Finally, as KYC does not involve static data, but dynamic data through the relationship with the
                    customer, it also needs follow-up and ongoing monitoring of the customer.</p>
                <p>15.6.1. <u>Customer identification and verification (KYC)</u></p>
                <p>The formal identification of customers on entry into commercial relations is a vital element, both
                    for the regulations relating to money laundering and for the KYC policy.</p>
                <p>This identification relies on the following fundamental principles :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Each customer (= each individual person and/or each person involved in the case of a legal
                        entity) must be identified by means of original supporting documents.</li>
                    <li>These documents will be recorded in a centralised system.</li>
                    <li>The identification must be completed by "face-to-face" contact.</li>
                    <li>Distance identification is also authorised and possible within a dedicated acceptance process,
                        but limits the opportunity to carry out certain transactions or to access certain products.</li>
                    <li>Each person identified must be registered by IT means.</li>
                    <li>A person will not be accepted as a customer if the identification process proves to be
                        incomplete.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The specific case of the due diligence exercised on the acceptance of politically exposed persons
                    (PEP).</p>
                <p>Concrete application at {{siteName}} is reflected by a specific identification procedure for
                    customers
                    referenced as PEP, whatever their place of residence.</p>
                <p>15.6.2. <u>Risk Profile calculation</u></p>
                <p>To assist in determining the level of AML/CFT due diligence to be exercised with regard to the
                    Customer, a “Compliance” risk profile is calculated first of all on entry into relations (Low,
                    Medium, High), and is then recalculated daily.</p>
                <p>15.6.3. <u>Customer acceptance policy</u></p>
                <p>15.6.3.1. <u>Customer Identification</u></p>
                <p>Client Identification is intended to confirm the existence and identify the individual with which
                    {{siteName}} has a business relationship and obtain supporting identity information. This includes
                    measures to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Confirm the existence of the individual through identification documents;</li>
                    <li>Conduct due diligence into the identity of the customer including:</li>
                    <li>Cross-referencing customer names against government watch lists;</li>
                    <li>Determining whether the customers are politically exposed persons;</li>
                    <li>Determining whether any third parties are involved;</li>
                    <li>Reviewing relevant publicly available information on the customer (e.g. adverse media, social
                        media);</li>
                    <li>Reviewing their background, reputation;</li>
                    <li>Keep records of all information and documents obtained.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>15.6.3.2. <u>Identifying Information for Customers</u></p>
                <p>This section sets out the standard identification requirements for individuals who have entered into
                    a business relationship with {{siteName}}. This outline is likely to be sufficient for most
                    situations. If, however, the customer is assessed as presenting a higher money laundering or
                    terrorist financing risk, in line with our identified risk matrix, then {{siteName}} requires
                    additional identity information to be provided and increase the level or verification accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>Where the result of the standard verification check gives rise to concern or uncertainty over
                    identity, the number of matches that will be required to be reasonably satisfied as to the
                    individual’s identity will increase. Any concerns must be reported to the MLRO.</p>
                <p>If a customer is unable to produce a primary ID, the reasons for this should be noted and they may
                    not be able to maintain an account.</p>
                <p>All documentary evidence must be recent.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passports and drivers’ licenses should be valid and not expired</li>
                    <li>Utility bills should be dated within the last 3 months</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In terms of beneficial ownership, we will ask every customer whether they are acting in their own
                    capacity or on behalf of another person. If they are acting for another person then we will require
                    details of such.</p>

                        acceptable on their own (a secondary check will be required such as a reference to a telephone
                        directory including an online telephone directory); or</li>
                    <li>Valid photo card driving licence (full or provisional); or</li>
                    <li>A solicitor’s letter confirming recent house purchase or land previous address.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When accepting evidence of identity from a customer, it is important that we make sufficient checks
                    on the evidence provided to satisfy us of the customer’s identity, and that we keep a record of the
                    checks made. This will be done by the MLRO or under the supervision of the MLRO.</p>
                <p>Usual checks on photo ID may include:</p>
                <p>Likeness against the customer</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Does the date of birth on the evidence match the apparent age of the customer?</li>
                    <li>Is the ID valid?</li>
                    <li>Is the spelling of names the same as other documents provided by the customer?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Checks on secondary evidence of ID may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do the addresses match the address given on the photo ID?</li>
                    <li>Does the name of the customer match with the name on the photo ID?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>15.6.3.3. <u>Identity Verification Triggers</u></p>
                <p>Verification of the identity of the customer occurs either when the customer has reached the €2,000
                    threshold or if the player is considered to be a high-risk player upon registration. The main
                    trigger for Identity Verification is considered a single transaction (or smaller, linked
                    transactions) that reach or exceed €2,000 either at deposit or withdrawal stage. For example,
                    transactions will be considered as linked when they are carried out by the same customer during a
                    single period of being logged on to the {{siteName}} website or if they are carried out in 48 hours.
                </p>
                <p>In all cases, the customer will receive a notification to upload identity verification documents
                    listed above. Each document that is provided by customers to {{siteName}} is checked manually by
                    dedicated staff.</p>
                <p>Further events that may trigger Identity Verification processes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When a customer requests a withdrawal to a different account than one that was used to make a
                        deposit (e.g. due to the fact that certain payment service providers do not support incoming
                        payments or other reasons). In these cases, the withdrawal requests will be immediately deducted
                        from the customer’s account, however, will not be processed until the customer’s identity has
                        been verified to ensure that the funds are going to the right person;</li>
                    <li>When a customer makes multiple deposits within a short timeframe (five or more deposits in one
                        hour);</li>
                    <li>Staff identifies suspicious deposit patterns and or several payment cards are used (three or
                        more different payment methods used within one week);</li>
                    <li>Registration country and IP do not match – In such cases, the player account may not be blocked
                        and the player may still make deposits and play games, however, no withdrawal will be allowed
                        until verification has been carried out;</li>
                    <li>When a deposit exceeds €5,000.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Copies will be kept of all the documents used for identification.</p>
                <p>15.6.3.4. <u>Additional Documents</u></p>
                <p>Additional documents may be requested from customers to substantiate their activities or to better
                    understand their patters:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proof of Bank Account – This may be a screenshot or copy of the bank statement stating the
                        customer’s name and IBAN and the name of the bank (for instances when a customer requests a
                        withdrawal to be deposited to a bank account);</li>
                    <li>Proof of Payment Card – This may be a photo or copy of the front side of the card in question or
                        a bank statement that will include both the card details and the name of the customer (for
                        instances when suspicious deposit patters are identified) –</li>
                    <li>To protect the customer’s card data, {{siteName}} informs them that they may obfuscate some of
                        the card details, however, the customer’s name, as well as the first and last four digits of the
                        card number must be visible.</li>
                    <li>Bank Statements and Payslips – These may be requested from customers displaying potentially
                        problematic gambling patterns and when external information available on the customer does not
                        validate the amounts being gambled. In such cases {{siteName}} would ask its higher volume
                        customers for documents which would support the funds being spent on gambling.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>15.6.3.5.<u>Mitigation of Impersonation Risk</u></p>
                <p>Various additional customer identity checks are permitted on a risk-based approach. These checks may
                    include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requiring the first payment to be carried out through an account in the customer’s name with an
                        EU/EEA regulated credit institution or one from an equivalent jurisdiction;</li>
                    <li>Verifying additional aspects of the customer’s identity, or of their electronic ‘footprint’;
                    </li>
                    <li>Telephone contact with the customer prior to opening the account on a home or business number
                        which has been verified (electronically or otherwise) or a call to the customer before further
                        transactions are permitted, using it to verify additional aspects of personal identity
                        information that have been previously provided during the setting up of the account;</li>
                </ul>
                <p>15.6.3.6. <u>Keeping Information Up-to-Date</u></p>
                <p>Once the identity of a customer has been confirmed, it does not have to be confirmed again. However,
                    if there is any doubt about the information held, then that identification will be obtained again,
                    including the identification of the customer.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} may review the customer documentation and then update it as appropriate. Any changes to
                    identification such as a change of name of the customer would require new documents to be obtained.
                </p>
                <p>15.6.4. <u>Ongoing transaction monitoring</u></p>
                <p>There are certain automated controls in place to monitor customer activities, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First time deposits;</li>
                    <li>Cash-out alerts for cash-outs greater than €1,000;</li>
                    <li>Activity alerts when customer pays to, or stakes with the casino €2,000 during any period of 24
                        hours;</li>
                    <li>Credit Card BIN alerts (when Credit Card country differs from player account country/IP);</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, all cash-out requests are processed manually by the Payments Team and are reviewed on a
                    daily basis. Every request undergoes security checks before approval in order to determine that the
                    origin of the funds/wins is compliant with the Gaming Control Board Curacao Policy and the terms and
                    conditions of the Company.</p>
                <p>15.7. <u>Organization of internal control</u></p>
                <p>Any member of {{siteName}} can report suspicious activities to the MLRO, as {{siteName}}’s Nominated
                    Officer. A suspicious activity is one where it is known, or suspected, there are reasonably grounds
                    to know or suspect that a person is engaged in, or attempting, money laundering or terrorist
                    financing.</p>

                <p>15.7.1. <u>Suspicious transactions reporting</u></p>
                <p>Having knowledge means knowing something to be true. Knowledge can be inferred from the surrounding
                    circumstances; so, for example, a failure to ask obvious questions may imply knowledge. The
                    knowledge must, however, have come to {{siteName}} during the course of business, or from a
                    disclosure (to the MLRO).</p>
                <p>Suspicion is more subjective and falls short of proof based on firm evidence. Suspicion is more than
                    speculation and is based on some foundation.</p>
                <p>An unusual transaction is not necessarily suspicious. Unusual patterns of gambling, including the
                    spending of particularly large amounts of money in relation to the casino or customer’s profile,
                    should receive attention, but unusual behaviour should not necessarily lead to grounds for knowledge
                    or suspicion of money laundering, or the making of a report to the FIAU. The MLRO is required to
                    assess all of the circumstances and, in some cases, it may be helpful to ask the customer or others
                    more questions. The choice depends on what is already known about the customer and the transaction,
                    and how easy it is to make enquiries.</p>
                <p>Members of staff who consider a transaction or activity to be suspicious, would not necessarily be
                    expected to know or to establish the exact nature of any underlying criminal offence, or that the
                    particular funds or property were those arising from a crime, money laundering or terrorist
                    financing. “Reasonable grounds to know or suspect” introduces an objective test of suspicion. The
                    test is likely to be met when there are facts or circumstances, known to the member of staff, from
                    which a reasonable person (in a payments firm) would have inferred knowledge, or formed the
                    suspicion, that another person was engaged in money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
                <p>A defence of failing to meet the test of suspicion, would be for staff to demonstrate that they took
                    reasonable steps to know the customer and the rationale for the transaction, activity or
                    instruction.</p>
                <p>15.7.2 <u>How to Make a Suspicious Activity Report</u></p>
                <p>Any member of staff, who is suspicious that a transaction may involve money laundering or who becomes
                    aware during the course of their work that someone else is involved in money laundering, must make a
                    disclosure to the MLRO using the {{siteName}} Suspicious Transaction Report form.</p>
                <p>Once completed, the form should be printed off. The member of staff making the report must sign and
                    date the form before giving it to the MLRO. The MLRO will take note of the date and time of report
                    receipt.</p>
                <p>Upon receipt of the form by the MLRO, they will then decide what is to be done as a result of the
                    report, e.g., whether the matter must be reported to Gaming Control board, Curacao. or not, or
                    further enquiries made and record its decision and the reason for it in the customer files. The
                    member of staff concerned must be informed of the decision and the reasons for it.</p>
                <p>If the matter is to be referred to GCB, the MLRO or a subordinate will complete the FIAU report form
                    and discussing with the reporting member of staff how matters with the customer are to be conducted
                    from that stage. The GCB report form must be signed off by the MLRO or the CEO.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} must not proceed with a transaction whilst we await consent from the concerned from GCB
                    it is given 7 working days (not including weekends or bank holidays) to consider the report.</p>
                <p>If we hear nothing then we may continue with the transaction but not inform the customer about the
                    report. GCB may give consent to proceed earlier than this time limit. They may also refuse consent
                    in which case they have a further 31 calendar days (including weekends or bank holidays) to further
                    consider the report. After this they must either begin proceedings or allow the transaction to
                    continue.</p>
                <p>The MLRO will submit a softcopy version of the report to the GCB. Any paper file for each matter will
                    be kept by the MLRO.</p>
                <p>There must be no record on the customer file or on the computer system which refers in any way to
                    suspicious activity reporting, money laundering, etc., to avoid the risk of tipping off. It is a
                    criminal offence to inform a customer that a SAR has been submitted, or to inform them of an
                    investigation into their affairs.</p>
                <p>All records of SARs will be kept in the central reporting file, which is kept by the MLRO.</p>
                <p>15.7.3 <u>How to Identify Suspicious Activity</u></p>
                <p>Transactions may give reasonable grounds to suspect that they are related to money laundering or
                    terrorist activity financing regardless of the sum of money involved. There is no monetary threshold
                    for making a SAR. Suspicious transactions may involve several factors that on their own seem
                    insignificant, but together raise suspicion that the transaction is related to the commission or
                    attempted commission of a money laundering or terrorist activity financing offence, or both. As a
                    general guide, a transaction may be connected to money laundering or terrorist activity financing
                    when we think that it (or a group of transactions) raises questions or gives rise to discomfort,
                    apprehension or mistrust.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} will examine, as far as reasonably possible, the background and purpose of all complex,
                    unusual large transactions, and all unusual patterns of transactions, which have no apparent
                    economic or lawful purpose.</p>
                <p>The context in which the transaction occurs or is attempted is a significant factor in assessing
                    suspicion and this will vary from one customer to another.</p>
                <p>Transactions will be evaluated in terms of what seems appropriate and is within normal practices in
                    business and based on our knowledge of the customer. The fact that transactions do not appear to be
                    in keeping with normal industry practices may be a relevant factor.</p>
                <p>Reasonable evaluation of relevant factors, including the knowledge of the customer's business,
                    financial history, background and behaviour is the basis of assessing suspicion. Behaviour is
                    suspicious, not people. We have listed below some indicators to help with this assessment.</p>
                <p>15.7.4 <u>Indicators of Suspicious Transactions</u></p>
                <p>Certain products, services, activities or channels may pose a higher risk of misuse for money
                    laundering. Listed below are several anti-money laundering risk indicators or “red flags” that might
                    be grounds for suspicion. The list is not exhaustive and not conclusive but will be used as a guide
                    for inquiry and follow-up, alongside other material.</p>
                <p>A single indicator does not necessarily indicate reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering or
                    terrorist financing activity. However, if several indicators are present during one or a series of
                    transactions, then we will take a closer look at other factors before deciding whether the
                    transaction must be reported.</p>
                <p>In the case of a transaction aborted in the belief that the property is owned or controlled by or on
                    behalf of a terrorist or a terrorist group, then there must be a terrorist property report. If there
                    are reasonable grounds to suspect that the transaction is related to an attempted commission of a
                    terrorist activity financing or money laundering offence, then a suspicious transaction report about
                    the attempted transaction is also required.</p>
                <p>Becoming aware of certain indicators could trigger reasonable grounds to suspect that one or more
                    transactions from the past (that had not previously seemed suspicious) were related to money
                    laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
                <p>15.7.4.1 <u>Application and Identification</u></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information mismatch from application</li>
                    <li>Application information/address/customer differs from initial registration</li>
                    <li>Inability to provide government issued identification details</li>

                        application</li>
                    <li>Lack of reliable third party and/or governmental verification of individual</li>
                    <li>The address indicated (or corroborated) is identified as mail drop or other high-risk address,
                        as opposed to a physical street address</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Stakes wagered by a customer become unusually high or out of the ordinary and the customer is
                        believed to be spending beyond his or her known means. This requires some knowledge of the
                        customer but, nevertheless, there may be circumstances that appear unusual and raise the
                        suspicion that he is using money obtained unlawfully.</li>
                    <li>It may be that the customer lives in low cost accommodation with no known source of income but
                        nonetheless is spending money well above his or her apparent means.</li>
                    <li>There is no set amount which dictates when a SAR should be made and much will depend on what is
                        known, or suspected, about the customer.</li>
                    <li>A customer exhibits unusual gambling patterns with an almost guaranteed return or very little
                        financial risk.</li>
                    <li>It is accepted that some customers prefer to gamble in this way but, in some instances, the
                        actions may raise suspicion because they are different from the customer’s normal gambling
                        practices.</li>
                    <li>Money is deposited by a customer or held over a period and withdrawn by the customer without
                        being used for gambling.</li>
                    <li>For instance, suspicions should be raised by any large amounts deposited in gaming machines or
                        gambling accounts that are then cashed or withdrawn after very little game play or gambling.
                    </li>
                    <li>A customer regularly gambles large amounts of money and appears to find a level of losses
                        acceptable.</li>
                    <li>In this instance, the customer may be spending the proceeds of crime and sees the losses as an
                        acceptable consequence of the process of laundering those proceeds.</li>
                    <li>A customers spend increases over a period of time, thereby masking high spend and potential
                        money laundering.</li>
                    <li>A customer spends little, but often, and his annual aggregate spend is high and out of kilter
                        with his expected spend.</li>
                    <li>A customer displays gambling patterns where spend is high but the risk is low, for example
                        gambling on red and black in roulette. The customer could be laundering money in a way that
                        guarantees minimal loss.</li>
                    <li>Instances of high spend by customers that lead to significant commercial risk for the operator
                        may also indicate suspicious activity.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Indicators to help establish suspicion that a transaction may be related to a terrorist activity
                    financing offence mostly resemble those relating to money laundering, although there are some
                    differences. For example, amounts relating to terrorist financing generally may be smaller.</p>
                <p>15.7.4. <u>Financial Sanctions</u></p>
                <p>It is the policy of {{siteName}} to verify the identity of all customers, and to check that they are
                    not the subject of sanctions or other statutory measures prohibiting the Company from providing its
                    services. The member of staff conducting verification of identity will complete the process by
                    checking that the customer is not the subject of sanctions or other statutory measures, using the
                    screening methods set out by the MLRO. These include the direct questions to the prospective
                    customer, screening of all new customers against sanctions and other databases (via direct reference
                    to an official list or using a commercially available product), and ongoing screening of all
                    customer names (via ongoing subscription to commercially available products and automatic uploads).
                </p>
                <p>15.7.5. <u>Adverse Media</u></p>
                <p>Along with Sanctions and PEP databases, third-party providers offer a service that screens
                    individuals for adverse media. {{siteName}} uses such a service to identify if a customer has been
                    identified by the media as having links to financial crime, terrorist financing and/or other
                    criminal activity. These individuals, once confirmed to be one and the same in both media and among
                    the {{siteName}} customers, would only be allowed to continue using {{siteName}} services after a
                    close review by the MLRO and/or senior management.</p>
                <p>15.8. <u>Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing</u></p>
                <p>As an extension to the AML/CFT efforts, {{siteName}} also employs Anti-Bribery and Whistleblowing
                    Policies and Procedures. These are standalone documents that are available to all employees and are
                    part of their onboarding package.</p>
                <p>15.9. <u>Employee Background Checks</u></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} is committed to establish and maintain procedures which enable it to be satisfied as to
                    the integrity of all new staff members and by extension their likeliness to follow the {{siteName}}
                    policies and procedures. To meet this requirement, the Human Resource Department is responsible for
                    undertaking all of the checks listed in relation to new members of staff and for retaining the
                    appropriate records:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Obtain and confirm references, if required;</li>
                    <li>Confirm their employment history and the qualifications they have;</li>
                    <li>Request a recent police conduct certificate; and</li>
                    <li>Request details of any regulatory action taken against them.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>16. <u>Fraud</u></p>
                <p>We will seek criminal and contractual sanctions against any Customer involved in fraud, dishonesty or
                    criminal acts. We will withhold payment to any Customer where any of these are suspected. The
                    Customer shall indemnify and shall be liable to pay to us on demand, all costs, charges or losses
                    sustained or incurred by us (including any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit,
                    loss of business and loss of reputation) arising directly or indirectly from the Customer’s fraud,
                    dishonesty or criminal act.</p>

                <p>17. <u>Responsible Gaming Policy</u></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its customers as well as promoting
                    the awareness of problem gambling and improving prevention, intervention and treatment.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}}’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment to minimizing the negative effects
                    of problem gambling and to promoting responsible gambling practices.</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} supports the generation of online gamblers offering them a wide range of games and
                    entertainment. We also take responsibility for our product line-up.</p>
                <p>The aim of {{siteName}} is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for
                    adults. The offered clear and safe products allow each user to play within his financial means and
                    to receive the highest quality service. Integrity, fairness and reliability are the guiding
                    principles of {{siteName}}’s work. It is therefore clear that {{siteName}} should do its best to
                    avoid
                    and reduce the problems, which can arise from participation in gambling, particularly in cases of
                    immoderate playing. At the same time it is important to respect the rights of those who take part in
                    games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of entertainment.</p>
                <p>Responsible Gaming at {{siteName}} is based on three fundamental principles: Security of the player,
                    Security of the game and Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research institutes,
                    associations and therapy institutions, we work on creation of a responsible, secure and reliable
                    framework for online gaming.</p>
                <p>Player security</p>
                <p>We take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of the players is based on
                    forbidding the attendance of the minors from participation in games and the protection of privacy,
                    which involves responsible processing of personal data and payments. Fairness and the random nature
                    of the products offered are monitored closely by independent organizations. Marketing communication
                    is also geared towards player protection: we promise only what players can receive in our
                    transparent line.</p>
                <p>Protection against gaming addiction: research – prevention – intervention</p>
                <p>The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation
                    for entertainment. Certain habits and behavior patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or
                    consumption of alcohol) which are considered to be normal and not causing any concern can develop
                    into addiction for some people and cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can
                    lead to problems for a small group of customers.</p>
                <p>Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation in the gaming line-up.
                    Subsequently the customers are provided with contacts of organizations where they can receive
                    professional advice and support.</p>
                <p>Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention</p>
                <p>The basic principle promoted by {{siteName}} is that the final decision and responsibility on whether
                    to play or not, and how much money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the customer
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective form of protection from
                    addiction. {{siteName}} sees its responsibility in assisting the customers by providing transparent
                    products, full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.</p>
                <p>Protection of minors</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to participate in games and make
                    bets. That’s why the confirmation of having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date
                    of birth are mandatory requirements during registration. {{siteName}} considers the issue of minors
                    taking part in games and betting very seriously. In order to offer the best possible protection of
                    minors, we also rely on the support of parents and caregivers. Please keep your data for account
                    access in a safe place (user ID and password).</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This software will allow you to
                    restrict the access to Internet resources inappropriate for children and teenagers.</p>
                <p>Responsibility towards problems</p>
                <p>{{siteName}} offers a variety of games and bets, which are forms of entertainment for the majority of
                    customers. At the same time the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support
                    and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining environment taking into account the
                    associated risks.</p>
                <p>The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer
                    from gambling addiction are not able to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive it as a
                    form of entertainment. {{siteName}} takes responsibility for such users by blocking their access to
                    its products for their own protection.</p>
                <p>Get informed with the main issues</p>
                <p>Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within their financial capacity is
                    fully acceptable. However, for a small percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment,
                    it is a challenge that must be considered seriously.</p>
                <p>What is the problematic game behavior?</p>
                <p>A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior, which interferes mode of life, work,
                    financial position or health of a person or his family. Long participation in games is counter
                    indicative to such person as it can lead to negative consequences.</p>
                <p>In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially recognized and enlisted in the list of
                    psychological diseases of international classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined as
                    long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for game, despite of existing negative
                    personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and delay of
                    professional growth.</p>
                <p>In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as dependence?</p>
                <p>It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can be qualified only by experts.
                    The material presented on this web-page will help you to estimate and define your own game
                    behaviour.</p>
                <p>The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any substance is that it is very
                    difficult to define the line between pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic
                    signals that may point out the existing problems. In the presence of at least five of the following
                    symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:</p>
                <p>1. The player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are only about the game.</p>
                <p>2. Bet sum increases in course of time.</p>
                <p>3. Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to be unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>4. When limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences irritation and disappointment.
                </p>
                <p>5. The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.</p>
                <p>6. The player tries to win back the lost amount,</p>
                <p>7. Lies about his playing behavior,</p>
                <p>8. Commits illegal acts,</p>
                <p>9. Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,</p>
                <p>10. Borrows to participate in the games.</p>
                <p>Rules for responsible games</p>
                <p>Following the rules placed below, you can enjoy the game without anxiety:</p>
                <p>1. Start playing only when you are calm and concentrated.</p>
                <p>2. Take regular breaks.</p>
                <p>3. Define for yourself beforehand the monthly amount you can spend on the game.</p>
                <p>4. Once setting a maximum limit, do not further increase it.</p>
                <p>5. Before you start playing, define the maximum amount of winning, after reaching of which you should
                    stop playing.</p>
                <p>6. Define the amount you can afford to lose beforehand.</p>
                <p>7. Do not start playing under alcohol or drug influence.</p>
                <p>8. Do not start playing in a depressed state.</p>

                    a payment) or prohibited transaction (including money laundering), we reserve the right to share
                    this information (together with your identity) with other online gaming sites, banks, credit card
                    companies, appropriate agencies and relevant authorities. (4) For the purpose of research on the

                <h4>Strictly necessary cookies</h4>
                <p>Strictly necessary cookies are essential to allow a user move around a website and use its features,
                    such as accessing secure areas of the website or making financial transactions. Without these
                    cookies, we would not be able to make our websites work efficiently.</p>
                <h4>During the registration process</h4>
                <p>These cookies will hold information collected during your registration and will allow us to recognize
                    you as a customer and provide you with the services you require. We may also use this data to better

                <h4>On our website</h4>
                <p>For visitors to our website, we use cookies to collect information. Our servers use three different
                    types of cookies:</p>
                <p>A ‘session-based’ cookie: This type of cookie is only allocated to your computer for the duration of
                    your visit to our website. A session-based cookie helps you move around our website faster and, if
                    you’re a registered customer, it allows us to give you information that is more relevant to you.
                    This cookie automatically expires when you close your browser.</p>
                <p>A ‘persistent’ cookie: This type of cookie will remain on your computer for a period of time set for
                    each cookie. Flash cookies are also persistent.</p>
                <p>‘Analytical’ cookies: This type of cookie allows us to recognize and count the number of visitors to
                    our site and see how visitors use our services. These helps us improve the way our sites work, for
                    example, by ensuring you can find what you are looking for easily.</p>
                <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies,
                    but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. The Help menu on
                    the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies,
                    how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies
                    altogether.</p>
                <h4>Flash cookies</h4>
                <p>You can modify your Flash Player settings to prevent the use of flash cookies. The Settings Manager
                    of your Flash Player allows you manage your preferences. To disallow flash cookies from all third
                    party content go to the ‘Global Storage Settings’ panel of the Settings Manager and de-select the
                    check box labelled ‘Allow third party flash content to store information on your computer’ and close
                    the Settings Manager. Alternatively you can also adjust your settings for specific websites you
                    visit through the ‘Website Storage Settings’ panel which is also found in the Settings Manager.</p>
                <p>If you are using an old version of Flash Player or older web browser, the Settings Manager may not be
                    available to you. We recommend that you ensure that you refresh your Flash Player and browser to the
                    latest available versions.</p>
                <p>If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to experience all of the interactive features
                    on our sites.</p>

                    necessary for the processing of transactions including, where necessary, the transfer of information
                    outside of your country. We take steps to ensure that our arrangements with payments systems protect

                    request.</p>
                <h3>10. SECURITY</h3>
                <p>We understand the importance of security and the techniques needed to secure information. We store
                    all of the Personal Information we receive directly from you in an encrypted and password-protected
                    database residing within our secure network behind active state-of-the-art firewall software. (Our

                    lawful age in their respective jurisdiction) or older. It is our policy to uncover attempts by
                    minors to access our services which may involve having to initiate a security review. If we become
                    aware that a minor has attempted to or has submitted personal information via our services, we will
                    not accept their information and will take steps to purge the information from our records.</p>

                    consent to any transfer of information outside of your country (including to countries that may not
                    be assessed as having adequate privacy laws). Nevertheless, we take steps to ensure that our agents,
                    affiliates and suppliers comply with our standards of privacy regardless of their location.</p>
                <h3>13. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICES</h3>

                    documentation in order to validate their accounts.</p>
                <p>Please note that the identification procedures shall be done before a cardholder starts operating and
                    using services of our merchants.</p>

                <h3>Why do I need to provide documentation?</h3>
                <p>There are several reasons:</p>
                <p>We are committed to providing a socially responsible platform for online gaming. All of our members
                    must be 18 or older and we are bound by our licensing agreement to verify this.</p>
                <p>Secondly, as a respected online and global company it is in our interests to guarantee maximum
                    security on all transactions.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, our payment processors require that our policies are in line with international banking
                    standards. A proven business relationship with each and every member is mandatory for the protection
                    of all parties. Our licensing agreement also obliges us to comply with this. </p>
                <p>Finally, by ensuring that your account details are absolutely correct, the inconvenience of 'missing
                    payments' can be avoided. It can take weeks (and sometimes months) to trace, recall and resend using
                    the correct information. This lengthy process also results in additional fees from our processors.
                </p>

                <h3>WHAT DOCUMENTS DO I NEED TO PROVIDE?</h3>

                </p>
                <p>Additional documentation might be required depending on the withdrawal method you choose</p>

                <h3>Responsible Gaming</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="announce-wrap">
                <p>{{siteName}} is committed to endorsing responsible wagering among its customers as well as promoting
                    the awareness of problem gambling and improving prevention, intervention and treatment.</p>

                <p>{{siteName}}’s Responsible Gambling Policy sets out its commitment to minimizing the negative effects
                    of problem gambling and to promoting responsible gambling practices.</p>

                <p>{{siteName}} supports the generation of online gamblers offering them a wide range of games and
                    entertainment. We also take responsibility for our product line-up.</p>

                <p>The aim of {{siteName}} is to provide the world’s safest and most innovative gaming platform for
                    adults. The offered clear and safe products allow each user to play within his financial means and
                    to receive the highest quality service. Integrity, fairness and reliability are the guiding
                    principles of {{siteName}}’s work. It is therefore clear that {{siteName}} should do its best to
                    avoid
                    and reduce the problems, which can arise from participation in gambling, particularly in cases of
                    immoderate playing. At the same time it is important to respect the rights of those who take part in
                    games of chance to a reasonable extent as means of entertainment.</p>

                <p>Responsible Gaming at {{siteName}} is based on three fundamental principles: Security of the player,
                    Security of the game and Protection against gaming addiction. Together with research institutes,
                    associations and therapy institutions, we work on creation of a responsible, secure and reliable
                    framework for online gaming.</p>

                <p><strong>Player security</strong></p>
                <p>We take responsibility for the security of our players. Protection of the players is based on
                    forbidding the attendance of the minors from participation in games and the protection of privacy,
                    which involves responsible processing of personal data and payments. Fairness and the random nature
                    of the products offered are monitored closely by independent organizations. Marketing communication
                    is also geared towards player protection: we promise only what players can receive in our
                    transparent line.</p>

                <p><strong>Protection against gaming addiction: research – prevention – intervention</strong></p>
                <p>The majority of users who make sports bets, casino bets and other gaming offers play in moderation
                    for entertainment. Certain habits and behavior patterns (such as shopping, playing sports, eating or
                    consumption of alcohol) which are considered to be normal and not causing any concern can develop
                    into addiction for some people and cause problems. In the same way, bets on sports and gambling can
                    lead to problems for a small group of customers.</p>
                <p>Clients with gaming addiction are prohibited from further participation in the gaming line-up.
                    Subsequently the customers are provided with contacts of organizations where they can receive
                    professional advice and support.</p>

                <p><strong>Self-responsibility is the most sustainable form of prevention</strong></p>
                <p>The basic principle promoted by {{siteName}} is that the final decision and responsibility on whether
                    to play or not, and how much money can be spent on the game should be assumed by the customer
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Self-responsibility of the customer is therefore the most effective form of protection from
                    addiction. {{siteName}} sees its responsibility in assisting the customers by providing transparent
                    products, full information and keeping a clear line of conduct.</p>

                <p><strong>Protection of minors</strong></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} does not allow minors (persons under the age of 18) to participate in games and make
                    bets. That’s why the confirmation of having reached the age of majority and the confirmation of date
                    of birth are mandatory requirements during registration. {{siteName}} considers the issue of minors
                    taking part in games and betting very seriously. In order to offer the best possible protection of
                    minors, we also rely on the support of parents and caregivers. Please keep your data for account
                    access in a safe place (user ID and password).</p>
                <p>Furthermore, we would recommend that you install filter software. This software will allow you to
                    restrict the access to Internet resources inappropriate for children and teenagers. These include:
                    <br>www.netnanny.com<br>www.cybersitter.com
                </p>

                <p><strong>Responsibility towards problems</strong></p>
                <p>{{siteName}} offers a variety of games and bets, which are forms of entertainment for the majority of
                    customers. At the same time the company takes responsibility for its customers by providing support
                    and tools for maintenance of a secure and entertaining environment taking into account the
                    associated risks.</p>
                <p>The clients who have difficulty in assessing risks, recognizing their own limits or those who suffer
                    from gambling addiction are not able to enjoy our product line-up responsibly and perceive it as a
                    form of entertainment. {{siteName}} takes responsibility for such users by blocking their access to
                    its products for their own protection.</p>

                <p><strong>Get informed with the main issues!</strong></p>
                <p>Most people play for pleasure. Moderate participation in games within their financial capacity is
                    fully acceptable. However, for a small percentage of people gambling is not a form of entertainment,
                    it is a challenge that must be considered seriously.</p>

                <p><strong>What is the problematic game behavior?</strong></p>
                <p>A problematic game behavior is considered to be such behavior, which interferes mode of life, work,
                    financial position or health of a person or his family. Long participation in games is counter
                    indicative to such person as it can lead to negative consequences.</p>
                <p>In 1980 the pathological game dependence has been officially recognized and enlisted in the list of
                    psychological diseases of international classification system DSM-IV and ICD-10. It is defined as
                    long, repeating and frequently amplifying inclination for game, despite of existing negative
                    personal and social circumstances, such as a debt, rupture of family relations and delay of
                    professional growth.</p>

                <p><strong>In what cases behavior of a person should be considered as dependence?</strong></p>
                <p>It is necessary to underline that the diagnoses of game dependence can be qualified only by experts.
                    The material presented on this web-page will help you to estimate and define your own game
                    behaviour.</p>
                <p>The special hazard of addictions that are not associated with any substance is that it is very
                    difficult to define the line between pleasure and addiction. Nevertheless, there are some diagnostic
                    signals that may point out the existing problems. In the presence of at least five of the following
                    symptoms, the likelihood of the severe dependence is high:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The player is deeply involved in gambling, all his thoughts are only about the game.</li>
                    <li>Bet sum increases in course of time.</li>
                    <li>Attempts to quit or control his participation in the games appear to be unsuccessful.</li>
                    <li>When limiting his participation in gambling, a person experiences irritation and disappointment.
                    </li>
                    <li>The game is a way to escape from problems or discomfort.</li>
                    <li>The player tries to win back the lost amount,</li>
                    <li>Lies about his playing behavior,</li>
                    <li>Commits illegal acts,</li>
                    <li>Spoils or breaks the relationship with family and colleagues,</li>
                    <li>Borrows to participate in the games.</li>
                </ol>

                <p><strong>Rules for responsible games</strong></p>
                <p>Following the rules placed below, you can enjoy the game without anxiety:</p>
                <ol>

                    <li>Define for yourself beforehand the monthly amount you can spend on the game.</li>
                    <li>Once setting a maximum limit, do not further increase it.</li>
                    <li>Before you start playing, define the maximum amount of winning, after reaching of which you

                </ol>
                <p><strong>Exclusion from games</strong></p>
